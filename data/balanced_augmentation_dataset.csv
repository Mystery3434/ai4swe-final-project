"As we entered PoGO, the system was janky, but wonderful Niantic stripped basic features and promised improvements in the future. The tracker used to list every pokemon within a 300yard radius. It was fantastic. Before that, it was EVEN BETTER. There were these little steps that told you how close you were to a pokemon. But then Niantic stripped all these features in leu of showing one pokemon that might be near a certain pokestop. And around when they implemented that they also added promoted pokestops at stores like sprint and starbucks. To top it off Trading and person versus person battles were promised at onset and never introduced.

"When i got luminosity and typed in my birthdate it told me i was illegible to create an account. So, naturally i just thought it was because of the COPPA policy in the U.S where you have to be 13 to create an account on appswebsites like social media. But when i changed the year to make myself 13 it still said i was illegible. Um, what So it isn't the COPPA policy. You guys just won't allow younger kids to participate in using this app to grow their minds This app is rated 4 so i'm confused as to why the creators of luminosity would have an account age restriction that's pretty low.

"Every house I see and call about is either sold or in contract. Some of them were sold months ago. It's useless. They send you the same houses over and over and over as new listings. The emails are endless even after you request them to stop and half of them are for areas I have no interest in. I see some that say potential listing What the hell is that It's either for sale or it's not. Glad it was free and even at that price it's not worth it. Someone should also update the overhead view options. I look at houses on my block and some of the pictures are over 5 years old. And taxes Why are they not even close with taxes I have seen houses that say taxes are 8000 but when I speak with the realtor they are actually 15000, that is a pretty big ball park..

"Swype is a great app and I give it 5 stars. If you disagree, try some of the other swiping apps. That said, why is it you cannot fix the issues that have plagued the app since day one Autocorrect cannot be turned off. The toggle onoff button is useless. This is how it has always been. Of course, nobody wants it permanently off, but I'd rather that than deal with Autocorrect's habit of changing common words to the most obscure word possible. When I type awesome, why are you changing it to sardine How often do you think the word sardine is used by your average English speaker You can't fix this And finally the personal dictionary. Why have an option of manually adding words to my personal dictionary when you will add them on your own You add email addresses and other useless words to the dictionary with no input from me.

"I'm amending my favorable review because the functionality has taken a turn for the worse. Specifically, Zestimates swing wildly.  I have received them monthly, and the latest is drastically different than the rest.  The main concern is that the past Zestimates are in line with our neighborhood sales but the latest isn't even close.  Compounding the issue is that past Zestimates are ignored in the historical chart. Another problem is setting Make me Move or For Sale by Owner  they don't work.

The only real problem I had was if you mark say a good Crappie hole on the map, everybody who has this app now knows exactly where ur spot is.

I use it a lot when fishing with friends in their boats.  I can mark a spot and transfer it later to my boat's GPS.  I have also used it, with the guide's permission, to record waypoints when on a guided trip.   It also works excellent when navigating to waypoints.  It gives you a current heading while under way and I have found it to be very accurate, both in recording waypoints and also finding spots.   I also feel secure having a backup to my main navigation GPS when on my boat that is potent enough to get'r done if I were to need it for something critical like finding your way out of some of the jungles in Texas lakes.

I do have a recording of it as well and you can definitely tell that it is the heart beat. We started around 31 weeks and have played around since. 4 stars because it's not perfect of course. Sometimes it's hard to hear or you can't hear but that also has to do with the baby's location. So, for 5 to get to hear the heart there and there isn't even a question.

"First time ever going into this facility, this experience has made me choose a different phone company. I believe here name is Nazareth and I couldn't believe how inappropriate her work ethic is. Not only was she constantly using her personal cell phone instead of helping customers but she had a horrible attitude after each time she spoke to whomever she texted. Her demeanor was extremely rude and made me very uncomfortable speaking to her. Not only was she rude but would speak Spanish in front of me as if she didn't realize I spoke Spanish myself and it was extremely vulgar. I will never go back there. This woman should never be allowed to be in customer service again

Every time you win a rally it will appear you have been given the appropriate amount of Toads, but check again. I usually only get about half of the color Toad it says I got when I win a rally while I'm maxed out. This made it very difficult to get the 2500 green toads I needed.

"I have to say that after using this app compared to the multitude of other weather notification apps that I have, I am not impressed at all. I live in Savannah, GA where we get some pretty bad weather from time to time and I like to know when that weather is on my back door. Just recently we had a mild tornado outbreak, as well as a slew of severe thunderstorms. Of all of the apps that I have for weather with the notifications turned on, NOAA was the very last app to give me a notification that the storm was happening, and at times that notification was almost an hour after the storm had passed. If this was the only app that I had giving me notifications, my family and myself could have wound up seriously injured or worse if just one of those tornado producing storms had hit my house and I was relying on this app. The sad thing is that this is a paid app, that I purchased for a little bit of reassurance during bad weather to give me some piece of mind and the only thing it has done is make me more weary about severe weather in my area. And for anyone that reads this and is wondering, this has not been the only time that the app has been extremely delayed in letting me know that there was bad weather approaching. It happened in April, as well as January, during the tornado outbreak across GA. So basically, it's not a fluke.

For example  my charge 2 tracker and app were in sync showing 20 mins of activity. After a brisk walk charge 2 activity was showing 30 minutes. When I synched it with the app, charge 2 reverted to showing just 20 mins of activity

"Pokmon go, is an awesome game, but apparently Niantic isn't very concerned about how many people play their game because of the recent updates. All this began when the time for Pokmon to spawn was changed from 5 to 10. Not a big deal, it was still fun and promoted walking. Then, there was a small grace period before they released their second fatal  update. They scrapped their tracking system. SERIOUSLY THEY REMOVED THE ONLY WAY TO FIND POKMON ACCURATELY That also removed all third party scanners, which literally was the only reason most of the players actually went to catch Pokmon. But more advanced trackers like FPM survived. Then they killed any form of hope by adding a captcha robot detector feature. Which removed all the advanced third party scanners. Being able to actually know where the Pokmon I wanted to catch were was the only reason I played Pokmon go. But I still played for a while by riding my bike and running certain trails. But then, the final straw was when Pokmon ceased to appear if you walked, ran or biked too fast. Now, all I can do in Pokmon go is walk around at the speed of Old man to catch a pidgey or two. Or if I'm lucky, a rare and elusive rattata. That's how much I care at this point. Pokmon go lost like 90 of its players because of Niantic's wrong decisions. Also, seriously, the buddy system is is complete and total garbage. Let me walk 5km to get 1 candy for my eevee And don't forget about Pokmon go's high end nearby tracking system. Which is completely broken. There was a koffing on the last slot which means it was the farthest away and suddenly it appears right in front of me. All in all, I don't think Niantic even cares about this game anymore. They removed key features and made the game unplayable.

"Goodbye google maps. You've been a good friend but you've taken me in circles one too many times. In fact just yesterday you took me onto 2 dirt roads in the rain only to emerge onto the same road we were just on. You could have just told me to turn right instead of left. Hopefully the person who programmed you to do that is found and fired. May his little games be ended soon. So, it's time that we part ways. Farewell google maps.

"The filters offered within this application are really quite fun. When I choose to post a picture, I find myself applying all of the filters to see which one I like best. Since you have to select each filter individually and wait for the processing, this can be time consuming. There are some hidden features, in the sense that it's not obvious they are there. You can drag you finger left right on the image to change the intensity of the effect. You can swipe down to create a split screen and move it around but it's a little clumsy. Also, if you want to save the image and post it, those are individual steps instead of selecting multiple actions at once. There is one thing I am unhappy about. You can't change the location assigned to a posted image and they use your current location instead of the location the photo was taken. Since I tend to up load photos once I am home, the location information is always incorrect. I would like the ability to apply the filters on my computer. I'm going to try and print some of the images just to see what happens. I really like the idea of this application, but it's not a mature offering yet.
