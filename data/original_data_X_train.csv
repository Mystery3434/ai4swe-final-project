This app crashes frequently. I love it but I may switch over to basic twitter for iPad.
"I have an iPhone 5. The scans here are the clearest I've gotten. Tried a few and no luck. I got amazing results with this app!! Easy to use, no watermark, emails fast. Love it!!!!!!!!"
C- crashes a lot. R- reloads and crash again. A- after reinstalling crash. S- Super CrashH- halfway there. Then crash.
L. Try this app.
great apps..thanks a lot more power
Love It!! High 5!!
It used to have many colors. Words overlap on my phone. It says I have tweets but when I click to see them it says its empty.
"Not as good as Twitter app, unfortunately."
Good game
Thanks lot
Best thing ever! Thank you now I can talk to my family overseas!
Easy to use... I've seen the light 😃 and it's coming from Tiny Scan!!
Its fine
"PAC-MAN's power. Amazing!!!!,i shot the ghost with laser,BOOM!!!!.Deathly shooter,watch out the glicth you can die,i can die if the Gray Ghost   woke up from sleep.....!!!!,get the Energy Ball for kill the Gray  Ghost or use a power from PAC-MAN,dont use cheat ,if you use a cheat you SUCK.😈"
i have a lot of fun but I'm stuck because on one of the house of the dead tracks in some areas all I see is my cart and everything is so dark it's pitch black and i end up crashing and falling and i can not progress further because of it.
The best app Guys the best app ever. I recommend it :-).
Great Works very well
So handy Great when you need an electronic version of a document. Extremely useful when so much is done via email and cloud. Image quality is okay and of course dependent on the original.
Notification problem I am back to loving this app fully :)
recent issues all resolved
I like it. And it's Free
Accelerometer use is WAY too sensitive.
"Keeps getting better, new list update works very well. In over 30 years of using and writing software I have never seen as well thought out design and implementation. Like all products there are small bugs and limitations, especially on small screens, but the amazing technology far outweighs the inconveniences. Not many realize the hidden gems in the OneNote ecosystem - smartphone photos with text have OCR applied, sync across platforms is almost instantaneous due to not using platform OS to store data (custom database .one files are outstanding), collaboration allows simultaneous editing with Google Wave like ease, hyperlinks and embedding allow any type info to be stored and accessed, excellent organization strategy of notebooks, pages, and subpages is fully indexed and searchable, etc., etc., etc. MS is ahead of the competition with this product."
Still the best I've tried lots of Twitter clients but this one combines tons of powerful tools with an uncluttered design and support for phones and tablets. Not as pretty as newer competitors like Carbon or falcon pro but way more usable.
"Better on a computer I loved the flexibility and ability to share and sync across platforms,  but the limited capabilities of the mobile app make me question if it's worth it.  S Note or Evernote  are much more flexible and user friendly."
The Best
Just downloaded this app & its saying Ive exceeded the twitter limit.
I especially like it is truly cross platform. I prefer it to Evernote.
"""This app is using a lot of battery."" Google gives me this update shortly after I open the app, without fail, since the latest update. Is this a known issue?"
Please update so when I send a tweet it doesn't crash.
One note Can't even tell you how much this app makes my life so much easier! I'm always on the go and to be able to work on the go is a necessity. Microsoft has all the tools I need. :)
Very very very very very beautiful
Very nice connection including FaceTime. Tried for the first time between USA and Dubai. Recommend for others to try out Viber.
Works just fine for me!!!!!!
Constantly crashing. There has never been a time I tried to tweet or update my timeline without a crash. It also  needs push notifications. Definitely switching back to the regular twitter app.
I can't believe how clear the reception is !!!! No more calling cards!!!
Please update it soon. It crashes too often.
Loved the new interface and improvements
Good app
Great
Like this app but wish it had push notifications. Will rate higher when updated.
Updated rating: (4 star) it finally worked. It initially kept giving me error message while trying to sign in. I just kept trying repeatedly; until finally it went through.. And now it works perfectly. Keep trying folks..However I would like to know-how to add notes on main screen. It just shows Personal(web) on the main screen and I don't see an option to add lists. I do see a screenshot in the app store showing several notes on main page. Previous rating: (1 star)Gives an Error message everytime I try to log in. Someone please tell me how to fix this??
"Good, Useful app, well done !"
"Sonic and sega racing is great on a console, not here. They managed to take all of the fun out of it and instead put in TERRIBLE controls, bland tracks, and decided to not add music during the racing. Not to mention the brutal missions thanks to overwhelming glitches. If you've played the real game, don't bother with this."
;)
If you need to scan stuff this is the app for it.  Have used it for several years and makes my workflow so quickly.  Especially useful for scanning items bound in folders.
"This app was great for the first month or two. Now whenever I try to open one of my notes, it says, Syncing Error. Edits saved to SkyDrive. I've been trying to access this note for FOUR DAYS now. I have tried deleting theapp, signing out, refreshing, going to Skydrive, and doing every thing I can to have my note show up! Every time I click on it, like a few lines will show up and the rest is just blanks and the note is all messed up. I am literally in TEARS because that was an IMPORTANT note and it isn't syncing. It's so ridiculous. I can't even copy the text on the note to place it somewhere else. I am so sick of this. I have THREE BARS and full Wi-Fi yet it still won't sync. This app has me in tears because I may never get my important note back."
"Since I got the upgrade, the app closes unexpectedly, the bottom bar doesn't work, and it's overall sucky. Please do something to fix this, because I'm ready to find a new twitter app."
The best app in the world
Having this as an iOS app I can now access ally notes on all my devices.
Good
"Works well. Good UI. There are undoubtedly ways to improve this app, but I haven't thought of any yet. Been using it for about 3 months.."
i won one game ohh wait i dident this is bull cant even start to race i wish i could but no just crashes every single time nice job sega 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I like the front page and seeing what is trending.
"I make a lot of calls from Germany to USA. If you're on wifi and the other person is on at least 3G, call quality is clear. Still have to try 3G to 3G. Over LTE calls sound so much better than normal phone calls."
Very good quality! This application like dream!
Love love love it
"Thanks Bandai for teaming up with Hipster Whale and putting their spin on this classic. I understand people's want for more content, but I realize this is licensed and any changes to the original are at the discretion of Bandai. That aside, I've always loved Pac-Man, and having it be endless is fantastic! Sure, running out of tokens or lives can be frustrating, but you can play for free without power ups, so win-win because Pac-Man. It'd be nice to have music throughout instead of just before you start. I found out about this game through the 8-4 Play podcast, and during their breaks, they play music. While I was playing, their break came up and they started playing Pac-Man Fever... It was a brief moment ecstasy before I realized it wasn't coming from the game. TL;DR, this is endless Pac-Man, and it scratches that inflamed itch just like Crossy Road (endless frogger) does."
I am able to complete my expense statements easily without the worry of finding a scanner on the road!
This game is a very good game to play it's fun and endless!!!!
Very good
I love this app. Have not had any problems so far. Unlike other twitter apps you for not have to pay for the mute feature. Features in this app are so much better than the Twitter app. The only difference in this and the full version is the full has no ads. That is the Only difference.
"WOW, real cool.  Can talk international at no cost..."
"Stops working Disconnection issue, although internet is working fine, worst issue ever from any app ive gone through..."
Wonderful reception . It's fantastic way of communicating worldwide. Imagine FREE OF CHARGE.
It's a great app but still room for improvement.
Very versatile!
"I'm worried they'll change it like they did on their app Planner Plus. They took my money, and never respond to emails."
"Best twitter app so far , but after the last update the ""hide retweet"" option is not working, and the gif still can't be viewed ."
Love love love this app. Calls are clear and don't drop anymore. Thanks for fixing.
Sucks with adds :( The official Twitter App is Better
Ads?! What's with the 'Top Apps' ads? I thought thus version was ad-free. :-(
"5/3/13 - STILL not getting notifications I'm not getting notifications, and don't notice any new messages until i open the chat (it doesn't even show as new). notification settings are turned on for both active and inactive chats. only when I'm actually on the app does it show i have a message. please fix! ----- months later and still no fix! I check for updates everyday, come on Shape, get it together please!"
"Wow wow wow , awesome , great app i've ever had  , easy to use , save money , fantastic , i love it  , am greatfull for this app 😘"
I like it. Three accounts in place instead of 3 apps.
Nice Awesome
Everything I've wanted in a twitter app. Easy user interface and great functionality.
Great !! You can post multiple accounts at same time and even with Facebook !! I love it
PAC man Best evahh
"These game was super awesome, but now the only thing it does is crash, crash and crash. Can you pleas fix the crashing thing. Thank you in advance!"
Simple to use and works great!
Works great no complaints...yet.  The unlocked pro version is what I use.
"The connection is very slow/non existent On different WiFi signals, this happens EVERY day and it is very annoying. Please fix this major issue."
We have Problem save video to Camera rool after update ti İOS 8
Love It !!!! Works great every time. So handy when I'm on the road and need to send documents to colleagues.
Perfect
"Good so far... Fun, have to watch some commercials, but u get stuff for them. Don't know what happens when u run out of credits to play with powerups, also it looks like c-coins aren't credits, could be more clear about that"
"I had many other apps for the chat, they were all troubling me with ads and were not working well. They were mostly slow. This app works very well most of them time but freezes once in a while. I still don't get easy to use feeling with this app.."
It's like getting a second brain...
Very good App!!!
"I was excited for this app but have noticed several shortcomings that will prevent me from using it:1. You have to have a windows live acct to use the app2. You can only create new notebooks online in windows live, not from within the app3. You can not file notes from within the app, you have to do it from windows live4. From windows live, you can not transfer a note from one notebook to a different notebookIn my opinion, skip the windows live and let all the functions be available from within the app... Then it will be a worthwile app, until then, its pretty useless"
Only improvement would be to get more of my friends on it. I send invites but they are not joining. Can you make the invites somehow more personal.
crashes aloott barely can get past the first screen without it crashing
"I have been visiting a community where my cell coverage is terrible, and have been having to use land lines to call.  I have just had an hour call with Australia and another one to Seattle.   Crystal clear. Amazing."
BEST PAC-MAN EVER
Okay game
Single player is cool but every time my friend and I try to play online it goes to the start of the race but never starts. Can any help me with this
Love it!!!!
The syncing is superb.  I can type on my iPhone or laptop & within seconds it's synced.  No more copy & pasting.
Very good quality and features
I love it I haven't had no problems so I'm 100 percent happy about thatc
Better than regular Twitter.
Horrible UI Latest update is just like putting lipstick on an ugly pig. Just holofy the whole thing like you did for Friendcaster already!
Pretty amazing
It's simple and efficient. I only wish there were options for font and background themesand such.
I've had IM+ pro for years. Very happy with it. A week or so ago it wouldn't load. Crashed before it would even open. I reset the app. Nothing. So I deleted it from my phone and re downloaded. I was sent IM + pro 7 and charged yet another 4.99. I was going to avoid making a fuss but sometimes it won't open at all. I have iPhone 4.
I really like this game BTW its pretty much the best game I EVER TRIED IT IS AWESOME!!!!! I really like this game is made by a BUNCH OF COMPANY'S I mean people only 3 company's maybe more but I really don't know
I didnt hate it ... But..i cant put and receive any code ...!! Bother
"What a amazing app,you can tex,talk and video all in this app .just awesome"
"Great game, way better than Crossy road"
AAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!period
"What I like about the app is the ability to use some of the old functions of Twitter that are no longer available (e.g., the RT feature). Overall I think the app is a great replacement or alternative to the official Twitter app. I use this one more."
"I use this app seriously all the time. I have several tabs to keep everything organized and I could not live without it. We are on the go so much and everything is on our phones, organization is essential. Love it."
"Fantastic Too young to have played the original, but this is awesome."
Good
i love this better than the original twitter app
Awesome
Needs push notifications and see who favorites your tweets.
Errors I keep getting a 501 or 504 error.  This is new
This game is the coolest thing ever and very addicting
This app crashes a lot. Please fix
The game is very cool and like the concept of it but only thing is just a few bad ghost glitches like there is the app that shuts down randomly after about 30 mins into it and it shuts down when you don't die for a long time. If the app shutdowns gets fixed it would be a great game.
Sometime good and some not
Best of them all Best notepad ever
This used to be the best app for Twitter. The last couple of upgrades have made usage difficult. Please fix!
Best twitter software
This twitter app is the best one out there for the iPad. It is easy to use and has a use UI.
I really enjoy the organization of this app. And the fact that it backs up online is even better. Unlike the Apple app and they don't charge me for extra storage so far. Haven't had any problems hasn't slowed down. Only thing I would improve is that when you type in the phone number or an email address you can click on it and it would automatically operate with your phone. Pretty cool app overall
very good
Good game It's kinda like crossy road but it gets boring eslty
Very good
Makes it all a bit more convenient!
"Hi guys. The app is awesome. But the more popular it gets, the more spam i receive. When would you implement report spam button together with blocking the contact? And also when will you allow me to let only existing contacts chat/call me and prevent unknown contacs from sending messages to me? This is getting more and more important each day. Thank you."
Best App No better Twitter app around.
"Well my twitter app doesn't really work when I press it , won't load , but this app is way smoother and better than the accual twitter app :) 5 $+@r$"
My viber no longer rings. Is there a way to fix this I keep missing my calls :(
do u guys get calls back
"Great overall, some niggles In terms of features, this is one of the best Twitter apps I have used. It handles multimedia better than most apps. Only downsides in my experience are the slightly clunky interface and the inability of it to read the EXIF data to orient images the right way."
My daughter is vacationing in Denmark and Viber has worked great for communicating with her. The voice quality really is better than a regular phone call and there is no lag. Awesome app. I bought some ViberOut credits just to help support the company.
Love this game MUST DOWNLOAD! But needs more characters but it's still great
"What I do like: has more features than any other Twitter app I've found. Easy to use. What I don't like: Crashes constantly! Sometimes the navigation bar at the top disappears and I'm stranded, having to restart my phone to reboot the app. The view conversation needs to be simplified. I don't get why it repeats... ???"
I can't live without!!! I can talk to family members all over the world for free! What can be better?!!!
"I love having access to my notes from all my devices!  Everything in one place, I am obsessed!!"
Pretty cool.
This app is super convenient and works great for scanning paperwork and the like. Fast and easy!
Very good
BEST APP EVER!
Great sync between Microsoft and Apple products
Slow on old phone The app is great but its very slow. I'm on an HTC EVO 4G and it takes forever to load.
"I love onenote - stable, high quality, fantastic UI, just works terrifically well."
Great app. I am able to talk and chat with people world wide on my Ipad
The application is used almost every day and I am really pleased with it. Great app!!!
"I recently purchased shadow with my 750,000 miles however, now he is not available after a crash. And my miles aren't there either. But when I go to my license it shows that I've accumulated 850,000 miles. I saved up for shadow and used him to get that 100,000 extra before the crash. I'm confused why I don't have him any more. Fix"
Good app I'm unable to connect to my skype account after updating from my previous version. Can you help me to fix it.
Bugs in new version
Lack of Persian (Arabic) language support I use this app on windows and its support's Persian but when I install this app on my Android phone my notes in Persian language isn't show correctly and characters are desperate from each other
Perfection This bring back some good old memories
I love it because it's good to talk to other friends I appreciate for that thank you
I used the free version once and instantly decided to pay for the full version. Money well spent!
Better just to take a picture.10 times better
Keep it coming. I would like the feature of creating sub tab categories within the tabs on the iPhone.
This would be a great Wii game and the into is great. Maybe some more characters like sonic heroes  for ps2(any one remember?on the Dreamcast? Game cube? so ya maybe character groups and race like that.
The best Fast and smooth
Great application! I use it all the time!
I downloaded because I have the PC version. I don't care for the fact that you have a Windows Live ID. I went to the trouble of creating one only to find there's not much you can do with the app. In my opinion the native app is better as you have some font choices and I can delete a note. I haven't figured out how to do so. I have another note application & it's much better. It was free so at least I didn't waste any money.
This game is so hard to play!!! Every time I turn it on everything goes fine 😃😃 until the race is loading😢. The game closes and I end up at my home screen.  😡😡 Please fix this!! 😡
I'm a teacher & I find myself frequently having to scan documents. This app has been so productive & handy for my usage. I've scanned my own made study guides & posted them to my student web page virtually working toward a paperless environment. This app is the best & the option to save the document to Dropbox is ideal! Love it!!!
Badiya hai
"Does what I need it to, in a slick manner"
It's cool It's fun
I like this game The game was amazing like
"after I input my name and choose the nationality, the game crash on my devices all the time, hope you can fix it asap."
"Initially playing this game, I was skeptical, as many game reboots fail to deliver a quality that represents the original game.  This game is an exception.  Not only do the clean graphics and fun gameplay represent Pac Man well, but this game is quite possibly more fun than the original.  A big thumbs up to Namco and Hipster Whale for this amazing game!"
"I've saved a lot of money using this app to talk to friends overseas. As long as your connection and bandwidth is good, voice is clear too."
"Drawing bugs Trying to create a hand-drawn diagram in OneNote on an Android tablet.  Small parts of my drawing disappear every time the app syncs, very annoying and frustrating."
"This app is amazing! Works incredibly well in Australia , China and the US! I travel extensively and text come through perfectly . The calls are crystal clear and loud ! Super App!"
This app has really saved me a lot of money from making calls. I recommend you download and install ASAP.
Issue Can't sign in
"Deleted it and installed regular, reliable twitter."
It's GREAT but the adds are annoying
Does a great job.  Simple and easy to use interface.
Not good You have to spend more money after buying the app.
Awesome Awesome
Ugh It wont even let me post anything!  This thing sucks.
Good Amazing game dudes
"This is a perfect utility to help me keep in touch with my friends overseas, and it's as cheap as free. Incoming cell calls will interfere, but the quality of the calls are quite good with a strong wifi signal."
PLEASE ADD PUSH NOTIFICATIONS AND AUTO COMPLETE FOR @ FOR ALL MY FOLLOWERS!!
Awesome
"This new version needs to be fixed because there are some bogs in there. When i want to see the photos that i sent to my friends, it jumps out of apps. Some times i cannot open the appPlease fix itThanks"
There is no way I could afford keeping in touch with my loved ones. Viber makes that possible.
Easy to use. No more spiral note books for me.
I've tried Evernote which is certainly a great product but the features of OneNote are just a bit easier to use. Keep up the great development!!
Wish it showed quoted tweets I wish it actually showed quoted tweets instead of just the link.
This app comes in handy for all sorts of things.
Like it alot
IM+ Awesome app!  I would recommend it to anyone
Easy to use and does what I need.
"FIX IT PLEASE Theoretically great app, but continuously signing me in and changing my statuses. Poor communication from developers, don't buy paid version until they fix the bugs!!!"
It's the best twitter app ive had
"Its the best. Makes my communication to my loved ones easier, may it be thru voice mail , text message, and photos as well. Its very reliable indeed. I had been spreading it to my friends."
Best thing that ever happened to our family - we can chat and keep up-to-date with all our activities and events!  Thank you! Love ... Love this app!!!!
I use this app all the time internationally. It works perfectly! I love it.
For $4 I want more It works well for a couple of weeks then I have to uninstall b.c it force closes without opening. Retweets should be displayed in the @ mention column. Color coding the tweets per user would be nice as well. And a real in app browser that shows more than the mobile page:) paid $4 for this app... I deserve it.
"It's not a bad app to use if your out of minutes or texts, it's really easy to use and helps you to be connected with your acquaintance and contacts for free! Overall it needs some enhancements such as video calling, Picture sharing... and more accuracy and acceleration on its function. I would give it a 4 star rate! 1 left to get my requests! :P"
"Call free price and free time, no limited...!"
great great app
"Very clean , simple and colorful"
It's awesomeeeee!!!
Viber apps Submit apps
"Great Client! I've been a user of IM+ since I had a  Treo 650 with PalmOS. I've used it on many platforms and loved it over the years, as both a paid (multiple times) and free user. But lately, it seems like the Android version isn't keeping pace with the iOS version. Skype support works there, but not here. Fix this with an update (even a paid one!), Shape, and I'll gladly up this review to 5 stars."
"Have come back Used you, was seduced elsewhere.  And now, sheepishly, am back.  Missed you!"
Getting worse? I like it when there was Friendcaster to go with it. My current version becoming more unresponsive?
I used to be able to play individual maps just not the grand prix but now I can't race at all.
Works beyond  belief!! TweetCaster Pro has everything you need most of the other apps  do not have a delete button if you want to delete a tweet  and don't have the proper Rte retweet too...  this is so smooth and you can custom design it... I love it! The only way to use Twitter!!
"First time I tried to start onenote, 15 seconds passed, and it still didn't finish loading. At this time I knew this app would only aggravate me every time I used it.  I'll spare myself."
Soooooo good you should get it
Your mom says it was Amazing grace
So much better than the first few versions and many of the desktop features are available now.
Fun game but ever since update it crashes alot
Fletes
How I can back all my massages?
I use this app at least once a week for work very belpful
"my account is not activate.i recived number, but result is wlong number."
"Great app, more colors please!"
I don't like apps that require me to enable ALL notifications. I don't like badges. Apple gives us options for a reason.
Great app Very convenient and user friendly
Will uninstal it.... Nw a dys its really a worst app... No service etc.... Wat d damn thing u've internet connection n telling no internet connection... What d damnd....
I think Tweetcaster has the best features of all Twitter apps. Fully featured!
"Love it!!! Just few drops with every calls:( but I can handle , it's FREE"
I love this game but this keeps crashing my iPod. Please fix this! I have the 4th generation iPod. Thanks!
amazing
Love this app as you can cast your tweets to both social networks! Only downfall is that you can't add additional FB accounts.
"Good game - stupid in-app credit system I like that the ads are optional for rewards rather unavoidable, but they ought to reward you with credits since that's ultimately what you need to enjoy all the features of the game. What are these stupid non-credit 'c's even for?"
Best Twitter app I've found. Only issue I'm having is that it won't let me connect to FB. Very annoying since I paid for the PRO version.
Incredible app
"I love this program, but I absolutely hate the fact that I can't delete my unused notebooks very easily. Having to log in to my cloud every time I decide to clean out my notebooks is extremely inconvenient."
Disconnects Always Barely works! I always lose my connection. I'm not the only one either if you read reviews.
Free calling stopped working. Eating up space with inadequate performance uninstalling it.
"I have several friends from outside the USA and now that smart phones are pretty prevalent, it's easy to access this app!  It's so good to actually hear their voices instead of just reading text. The only complaint I would have is that you need to have really good Internet service on both ends when talking on the phone. Otherwise it's an excellent form of texting using just 3G or 4G! If I didn't have this app then texting would be $0.50 PER TEXT!!Five stars. Recommended app!"
Thank you so much. The sound quality is unbelievable. Plus being free is just icing in the cake.
Pacman This is a good game
Where's the bgm (background music)
Need token? I bought this app 2 years ago. Loved it. But now I go to sign in yesterday and I can't! You say I dont have a token? Realllly?!  Wth?
"I do almost daily calls to Germany and Viber works flawlessly 99% of the time. On rare occasions the connection will fail but that is the same with a normal cell call. Call quality is crystal clear, as well. Just get it!!"
Living on a military deployment and this a great medium to keep in touch back home. More robust text app than Apple's app.  Thank you Viber.
I travel for a living and Viber works better than my FaceTime! Even when it says poor quality I still seem to have a great connection.
I use this program every day for both business and personal stuff. I love that it automatically syncs to all of my devices.
"I can scan, email to gmail and print. Love this app!"
This app. Is thes way to comunicate!!Wao!! Thank.
Viber seems to always end your calls after five or six mins onto your conversation.  It gets so frustrating and irritating when u have to constantly keep calling back to the other party.. Please fix this!! Does anyone have this problem?
Good game I guess its a good game and is also VERY addicting i have only had it for 2 days amd have been on it non stop
Love this app thanks
I love this game to my hearts content ❤️ I live this game everyday I soon figured out its like Crossy Road but much better! And what the concept of the game is and what it means: U r on lvl 256 and the glitch u r running away from is the glitch of lvl 256 in the original Pac-Man! Cool huh?! Well I love this game so yeah! 5 Stars no doubt
Way better than the native iphone app.
Great app Worth the purchase
Addicting Great time killer
Their latest update is dumb as all hell. People don't want the back button to disappear when opening a picture. I'm going to kill myself if they don't change this. Emotionally.
Pretty awesome Does everything I need it to do.
"Love, love, love it!"
Nice game
Seamless
Pretty good. Works well enough. Freezes up every once in a while.
Great software everBut if possible please add undo optionSome time when I select of my written text just vanish it may be my fault but if there undo option then it would be great!!!
"Doesnt work! I am so frustrated, when i open it it just crashes, and now I am just hoping that i could play your fun pac man game. Until it doesnt crash, 1 star."
"Love it. Between my PC and my phone I'm in sync, That's good for me. If you use notes..... This is the app. It's part of office now and is integrated perfectly. I live by OneNote. One place for all thoughts, ideas, personal or professional"
Good
Remove the ads Not happy!
API consistently gives errors Used to be great
Please update to the look and feel of iOS 7
Fix Facebook login Still can't connect. Uninstall ed and installed it again still the same.
"Great for traveling. Wifi is all that you need.  Saves a bundle , dice you can talk or text."
great app to use!
Awesome
Bad UI
5 stars if the app allows for video chat for mobile users and not just only for the pc.
"I use OneNote on my laptop and love it. The app works pretty well but has bugs when trying to sync with more than one user. Also, why hasn't an iPad version been done?  That's where OneNote could really shine."
"Another stupid idea of Microsoft Well,  the program looks promising, as most of Microsoft programs, however, you can not use it without signing in so they would track you. Go to hell,  I  am uninstalling.  I do not need your services."
Many great options Just about perfect ;)
It'll do I'm easy
This tool is like having a giant flatbed scanner in your pocket.  Turns PostIt flip charts into PDFs quickly and flawlessly.  Emails and drops into various cloud storage programs without a hitch.  Could not live without it in our biz.
I would say it is the best app.I love it
Love this app it's just missing push notification and some type of sound!!!
Can't access files saved on anything except OneDrive I can't access my files saved on Google docs.  This application only allows me to see files saved to my onedrive.  Well...Onedrive doesn't like the onenote file extension.  this proprietary stuff is for the birds and Apple products.  Please address this.
The gesture to swipe right to view the menu is interfering with the scrolling gesture making navigation a pain. Otherwise great ap.
Profile photo problem Can't see profiles properly and I also can't see photos in profiles.. but works pretty well..
Great app the ads don't bother me no reason to pay $5 for the pro version
While a nice note program OneNote is still incomplete and in need of features like new note creation. Until then this program is simply a note viewer.
Ok
Very nice app
"Excellent app , the new version is perfec."
Work vey good for me
Do you know what's weird i got this game the first day it came out but about a month before it came out I was thinking they should make one! Know to see if it works I'm hoping for a Mario cart:-)))))) also just add that Purple guy from sonic and that zombie dude and some more tracks
Want video chan with Viber . I love Viber
"I use One Note daily for my mathematical notes, proofs, and formulas.  Although I do love the ideal of this mobile version, unfortunately anything edited with the equation editor does not show up on the iphone.  Hopefully this is something that can be fixed with the next release, I can think of thousands of ways to use this!"
This is good app. I used it a lot...
"Please fix it, I want to play this game... But I can't even get past the title screen!"
"Excellent app Scan and email on the go. Brilliant. Time saver, life saver."
Excellent for free call & text
Great app. The best twitter app out there. BUT WHY AM I SEEING ADS ON A PRI VERSION. this is ridiculous. Come on guys pull the ads on the pro version.
Can find faults and complain. But u know what! It's FREE ! And costs me nothing to stay in contact daily with a friend in another country. I appriciate this app
A nice twist !
Viber is good app. Please update for ios 7 UI .
Top dog The easiest for Twitter.
The game is awesome.  The one thing I don't like is that sometimes it crashes while you are playing.
Rogers Very useful
"Best twitter app out there Best twitter app out there. Whatever you want of features, it has it."
This app has been broken for months now. The support page goes no where. Helllloooo!!! The pics  do not show up.
Love it!
It's official like a ref wit a whistle.
Just please update to iOS7.
"Between web and iOS versions, I'm never without my notes."
Amazing Endless runner PAC man doesn't sound that good and oh boy are you wrong. This game is amazing
Not updating Getting an error message 505 when installing  this update.
Last update is awful. This app runs so slowly that it is essentially worthless. Used to love how well it organized tweets on the screen. Now will just go back o original client and stop wasting my time.
I have an iPod touch 4th generation and I can't even get to play the game because it crashes every time
"Call Quality is above par, very clear."
Useful
Hi folks just make sure both parties have internet connection either wifi or 3G. Works flawlessly. Super duper fast and very awesome to use. Only thing I would want more from this app is the ability to set custom text tones. Right now nothing in the settings that you can use to assign different/custom text tones.
"Best application ever for long distances, since I have it I call my family through this application and works perfectly"
Thank you ❤😁😋😘
"I wish you would get notifications when someone tweets you, RT, or DM you. Sometimes the app closes when I try to post a message."
Vine videos don't work anymore for whatever reason
"Real nice and convenient. Skype and whatsapp, look out!"
"Well done Microsoft!! OneNote is a fantastic program, perfect for day to day stuff and college notes. In fact, everything where a word processor isn't quite the write [sic] tool. I've been waiting for an iPhone app to use OneNote remotely, and this exceeds my expectations!!If you are a OneNote user, I really can't see how you could be disappointed with this perfect companion. Great looking and does the job perfectly!(I had a problem signing in at first, but resubmitted a few times and it worked - now I have no trouble logging in)"
"A 5 star App, very easy to use, lightweight, faster and more reliable than Twitter. :)"
Over all it's good I like it.
Very poor quality connection .. Terrible ..
Bought this app took away interactions I will using Ubersocial from now on.
"Except for the network quality always fluctuating(only on this device), it does what it's meant to do."
We use this to keep in touch with family.  It's great!
Works great
"It works well on iPhone 6I have lost some added material once, but overall I love it."
"Newest release much better Now that the ability to add sections has been added, the app is much better and mimics the desktop platform. Well done.  --previous review-- The best note taking app I have come across. Great app and syncs all notes well with the desktop app on my PC. It is still a bit limited in that new notebooks nor sections can be added within the app (hence only 3 of 5 stars), you need to create these on the PC. On e they are created the ability to access and edit them in the app is simple and efficient."
Great app
So far impressed. Talking to our son in Japan as he travels.
"Since upgrading to an iPhone tweeting with Tweetcaster is great! I can do so much more, xoxo."
"Great app if you use MS office, it syncs well with their one note utility. Only wish  you could specify which folder a new note goes into."
The latest update has its good and bad but mostly bad. I can't scroll when texting so I can't return to the beginning of my message before I send. I've noticed that the message doesn't send when you swipe upwards now which is a plus. The main issue is the notifications. There's no sound when someone calls you. This causes many missed calls.
"Love OneNote! The features and functionality allows me to outline, layout information and notes, as well as tasks succinctly. A great must have tool in the app world."
I tryed to ride and I close and I can't get me to try to drive it
Great take.. ...on a classic game
This is my preferred app for communicating with people all over the world.
Call quality is too poor
Love it Ylerps
Fantastic
Great app! Has replaced Catch as my primary note taking tool back in 2013 and has been instrumental to assisting my workflow ever since than.
Bestttt
Nybadboy It's easy and clean
The game doesn't allow you to make the moves in the direction you intend.
This is a very fun and addicting game almost as good as the original but who wants an exact copy? We already have a version of the near original pac man to download and they have some at arcades still so it's good to find an addicting different version that almost as good as the most original and it seems like it's based a bit on pixels.
I can't update it in my phone it takes way too much memory.
Great technology innovation.
Always works the way it should I recommend to everyone!
Love the concept of upgradeable Pac-Man
"Massive issues on the 6plus, fix it!!!!!"
Excellent app Love it.
Just using pro It's look like good application
Amazing It's like the real version of pacman but  it has this cool twits to it 😃🎮
Love this app. Works great.
"Stickers and pics doesn't load I don't what's the problem with viber because stickers and pictures doesn't load, I can't send also pictures. Good thing I can use video calls.. hope u fix this or send me updates. Thank you"
"This is a very easy to use app as it gives you the option to post not only to Twitter but to Facebook as well. Very customizable and clean lay out. However, as with all Twitter apps it lacks the ability to accept follow requests. I think it should be free but not bad. Also, I HATE the lack of push notifications, if I'm not on my app I don't realize I've been mentioned or have been sent a private message. Otherwise, by far my favorite twitter app."
Very good solution for long-distance relationship mobile bills 😃
"This little app is great!  It is smart, quick, and compact.  I hardly ever use my all-in-one scanner anymore!"
Quality! The best twitter app out there! Simple as that!
Excellent.  . Best messaging app for android. Supports push technology.
This game is awsome! And also i got it for free yay so happy!!!! Thnx sega make more free games!
I like this app better than the normal twitter app
"I've tested this app for a few days and came to the conclusion the whole version was worth a purchase. Unfortunately, the full version is a whopping 5$. I'm afraid I won't be purchasing the full version until the price is dropped to 3$ or less."
It's great
Excellent app with outstanding resolution
I love this
I love this app. It allows me to stay in touch with friends worldwide.👍👍👍👍👍
Excellent connection overseas even to Beirut
Love the new quote feature.
"Sometimes cuts off and has static but for the most part I'm able to talk to my Mom in Australia, which is amazing!"
Great app to use if you use one note on desktop. Great way to stay organized but there is a few bugs. A lot of emojis don't work Like 1⃣👨🏻👨🏽👨🏼 these emojis and many more does not register inside of the app. Please fix.
Very good
"Viber is nonpareil! Wife in Chamonix touring the Alps and we have been able to talk, send current video and pix at will. Thx for the great product."
I used this product about 6 months ago and had given up due to bad phone quality. I was amazed today at the quality of the 3 hour call I am having with a tech support group in  Manila from Austin.  Kudos to the Viber team for fixing the old problems.
Works great on iPhone.
My fave app for twitter
Facebook dont connect since last update Facebook dont connect since last update and is not for first time when this app have bad update. I am really sorry that i bought it!
Very happy with this early version.  We need refinements including full sign-out (now to keep notifications off or to fully delete call history we need to uninstall and then re- install to sign in as a different user on the same device ( think : shared iPads etc)Keep up the great work!  Great app and service.  When will you add video?
"Great app, zero problems"
Product is crap now The latest updates bog down my Galaxy S3.
Great to have esp during trips outside the country
"I've tried many, many scanning apps. Tiny scan is the best I've used.  Functions perfectly and is easy to use.  I especially like that it links to Dropbox.  I also use tiny fax.  Same thing, I've used several-but theirs is the best."
"The Best! I love it, I get to talk to my wife over the WiFi and it's super clear, she sounds like she's in person with me talking."
WOW! I'm a newbie to Twitter and this makes tweeting so much easier!
Fast n smooth Really nice twitter clientt. Run fast in my low end device
One if the only apps I've paid for and I'm glad I did! By far the most useful app I use at work. Saves time and the hassle of using my laptop and printer. Easier and cleaner than Scanner Pro. Options to link all of your cloud programs and EverNote is stellar. Download now!
Pretty Amazing This game is really fun and addicting definitely 5 stars I love it it's so original 😋🙌❤
No Just no
Not bad Works great easy to use
"Best app for twitter - After trying several other twitter apps, Tweetcaster is defintly the best for the andriod system."
I CANT POST PHOTOS! I cant post photos.. it keeps telling me to move to twitter v1.1 when will you provide an update for this. Everything else is perfect.
Real nice so far!
"Love it, tried the others and they don' t compare!"
love the layout option!
Freedom of connection
Great app period
My iPhone will not update to IOS5.. So it will not allow me to download the original twitter app that I once had. I find this app easier to use. It is more efficient with more features! Very great app!
Good game Great to kill time
I tried to even call people without Viber and it doesn't work! Useless. I could only call and text other people only with Viber.
"So far the game is decent. A little confusing at first with no distinct directions to go up. Also a lot of ghosts, kind of difficult."
"Needs more features Less features then Windows version. No selection option, undo, adding shapes etc"
One of the best I like it very much
Very good program thanks for thatI love viber ....;)
"Several tweets missing At the moment, ""load more"" isn't working, and instead of ""filling"" the gap, it just removes it."
"Used to be great Now I just can't log into my Skype accounts, for the rest, os a great app."
This is a mostly great app. It could use some tweaking but all in all it's exactly what I need and the best I've found. Kudos and recommended.
it keeps saying false parsons as soon as I install it. I've deleted and reinstalled many times and still doesn't work.
Cant even download the app
"This for sure is on my top 10 best games! This game is great for pastime, however, you guys could make the upgrade times shorter. Keep up the good work!"
Just wish u could in corporate Facebook into it more if u could. If not still an awesome app for twitter.
I used viber many times and happy to say it is very very good today I used it free but sometimes I use it with small charge .... I can't say everything the only thing I can say is I advice every one to use it
The app constantly crashes and twitpics and twitvids never load. I also wish is synced to the iPad app so I don't have to re-read tweets on each device. And push notifications would b great!
Flawless. Best app ever. I mean it!
Very clean interface and easily accessible links.
Not working Crashes on startup
Excellent for long distance calls. Very clear.
Better than expected
"I've tried almost every note-taking app there is available on the market, and this is the only one that I'll use; however, with that being said, I would like to have more options available to allow for more organization. First and foremost, I would really appreciate the ability to rearrange/delete/etc. notebooks directly from the app instead of OneDrive (I prefer that my notebooks be in alphabetically order.) Also, I heavily rely on colors for organization, so if there were I way that I could manage those as well that would be absolutely perfect."
I was told about other applications that didn't work overseas.  This app does exactly what it says and the cut offs are minimum depending on your wifi service.  It has been awesome in keep me connected to my family. Absolutely must download.
Where is the new retweet embed with comment function?
Great for writing roleplaying games
This is a fantastic app for scanning documents. Easy to use and worked well for sending docs to email.
The new update makes the reception much better.  Great app!
Why is it so big?!!
"Controls You should add a control scheme with manual acceleration and or controller support, because I want to control all the things. (Nvidia shield support plz.)"
Great app so far. No crashes yet as the default twitter app stinks and crashed regularly on my ipad1. Lots of functions and most of all it just works. Happy tweeting
I love viper Made the world just like a small town
"Incredible so far.  Great clarity, no delay.   Instant text response.  Will revisit after a week if things change.  Comm has been between Florida and Paris, France"
"Klean good fun A lot of Pacman wannabe games, this one like crossy road and fun since crossy road and frogger is fun"
I love this apps features! I'm hoping the next update has a feature to edit tweets without totally deleting them tho.
Excellent It's easy to use
Need to improve quality
F***ing Love it
Tweetnice Good
Amazing I don't know what to say
I've tried Evernote. This app is more streamlined and easy to use for my needs.
"OneNote is one of my favorite apps. It's so easy to use, I'm so glad that its available for the iPhone and on the Mac."
Works great
"Good Embedded tweets support please, it's annoying to open in new screen"
Work around e-mail it to yourself then it will only make a 1 page PDF file out of six pages can't read the printed page.  Been a fan of notes for years but this app has ruined it for me
Excellent application thanks to its creator) or creators
"Saving me a ton of money.  Phone calls, generally very clear and no dropped calls.  Messaging a real plus.  No humming and background noises compared with Skype."
"I have dowloaded it several times and every time I try to open it ,it always closes on me"
Absolutely looooove this application and it just keeps getting better and better. The sync between devices is seamless. The feature set is quite impressive. Just all around excellent software design. I really like that the mobile app now supports locked sections and uses Touch-ID login. That was my last minor hang up and it's now resolved :)
This is proble the best app I have ever bought it has alote of things on it and it is super fun to use!!!!
Wonderful app. Would most definitely pass word to friends!!
YEZZUR!!! THE BEST N ONLY TWITTER CLIENT I USE!!!
"To play the game, I place the iPad in airplane mode.  Seems to work fine with a glitch every now and then.  I managed to complete an entire grand prix without a restart."
"Skype Skype problems, still :("
Soon
I installed this game twice and it wouldn't even let me race
I use Viber constantly! It helps me stay connected with all my relatives overseas and friends! I don't even use Skype anymore.
Thanks for being the awesomest ;) and being the best choice for us all who are far from our families around the globe!
It crashes even though it got updatedIt doesn't save Every time I go to options it takes me out and when I change my controls they just reset
Crashed 95% of the time
Love it
Can't log out? This app is good minus the fact you can't sign out. Please add this option. Will be using Ubersocial till then. It has more options.
Speachless Speachless that's how Good this game is $$$$$$$$♡♡♡♡♡
It's alright
"If I want to talk or send free messages to someone, I simply ask you to install Viber and that's it."
Love the layout as well. Very user-friendly and looks clean!
Intrusive sound ads now Really loved this app but lately hidden ads start playing sound all the time.  Using it less and less now because of this.  And I will never be buying vicks vapour rub. ☺
Yes
Thank you for a good application.
Back to 4 stars Thank you for listening to users and adding back features.
"Underrated app It has just the features Ive wanted for a long time now! Hurray! Some feedback: I would give u a 5 if you could make more simple to use. E.g. i have to press on Back key after inserted a photo so to be able to make notes on the photo. Secondly I want to be able to choose text writing on my photos (different colors, fonts and sizes). Not only hand writing.  Id be very happy for this. Thanks in advance"
I'd give it a minus star! It's constantly telling me I'm not authorized! tells me I've reached my 350 max tweets per minute after my FIRST tweet of the day! CONSTANTLY CRASHING. I EVEN PAID FOR THE PRO VERSION!!!! I'd like that money back! This app is HORRIBLE! DO NOT DOWNLOAD. ESPECIALLY DON'T PURCHASE IT! The iPhone OR iPad version! iPad version is THE WORST OF ALL!!!
I love it 💙
"Way too many crashes, personally I think they should have more characters to be unlocked. Overall, pretty good, pretty decent graphics for an IPod. Patience people. It just came out, de-bugging takes time."
Love it Great app
A1
great makes twitter manageable for novices. nice clear aesthetics.
"Great application! One of the top twitter apps, that also posts to facebook!"
Tweetcaster Use it alot
"Galaxy s3 Keep on getting error ""Facebook connection failed"""
Cool
"Thanks a lot for the overseas telephone ,, it is awesome."
"No Slow, slow slow... What happened"
"I had tried several way to call internationally ,viber was the best of them ,"
It wouldn't even download. This really need to be fixed.
The best app ever created. That person is genius
I like it works good for me
"Asked to be rated, 2 stars off"
Very good
OneNote Manage activities and memos for later use
"Michael O'Leary Fantastic! Hated twitter's lousy app, love TweetCaster soooo much! Zip idea the best! Keep up the good work!"
"This application allow me to  handle my documents insuch a way that I could not be done with a phone, having the option to scan my documents to put them in the cloud after all is very usefull, easy to use"
I agree with other current reviews...THIS VERSIONS KEEPS CRASHING!
Too many ad's but it works just fine.
"I don't see why people are complaining.  Easily the best twitter application out there, I recommend it.  Running perfectly on iPhone 5 iOS 6"
Very useful and easy
"I love using this app, and I really love that now we can access password protected pages,but I have one suggestion. Could you add a search feature?  I keep a page of websites and passwords, password-protected, but when I need to look up a password for a certain site, it takes a while because my list is not alphabetical. There are actually many reasons why having the capability of searching, at least within a page, would come in very handy."
Great way to waste time. Lol
The best
Love what Microsoft has done here.
Works great with note s pen
"I wish it has a way to share pics voice message, or video message....Keep it up boysCheers"
"I cannot get it to sync with my fb account. Simultaneous updates is what I'm looking for, but this not working on my 4s is agitating."
"This app worked great when I had my Note 4. But now that I have an iPhone it's all messed up. Incoming messages don't load right away, my location changes with each message I send, and sometimes just turns off for no reason."
I can't play!! Plz fix
Pacman Not bad for a free app so far so good with day 3. Great Pac man game though!!
Pacman Gosts
It will make you wonder how you got by without it. May not be as high fidelity and a fancy flat top but really does it matter for most stuff?  Best five bucks I spent this month.
Does what it says This works for me.  Job done! Even better since update well for me anyway.... Why don't you decide?
"I've used Viber for a very long time and it's always served me well. The phone calls and the chatting is what I utilize most and never had an issue until I just updated the app and I can't seem to send any messages. When I do try to send a message through chat, the app crashes. EVERYTIME. I've turned my phone on and off several times thinking it could be the cause of something else but the app is still crashing during every message I'm trying to send. Help please??"
Pacman Fun.....
Gn Gn
"This version is Slow on iphone 5, unusable."
I want to play but it crashes please fix it
😍😍viber😍😍
Better than Über and Twitter App by far..!
"Quite a decent customer Well, quite a decent customer. Very pleased with the ""Compact mode"", given that my phone has a small display! But recently I have been seeing problems with scrolling through the chat when receiving messages, as well as other minor oddities. And yes, what is the matter with the OTR package? Why is it proprietary, closed and even paid for those who purchased the Pro version?"
Slow after update.
"Spring Chicken Loved the game on the 8bit, 5 stars even though I have not played it as yet. Why? I know my Samsung tablet 10.1 is no spring chicken, it is the second ark of it's kind, but please (grumble#!/+) make this compatible with older devices. Yours truly...spring chicken at heart (not so much upon the gut)..."
"I'm an educator and was using Evernote but all my journals got erased bc I was using the free version and not much space. Searched several other applications but many were basic and I couldn't ever do what I could with Evernote until I tried ONEnote. This application does everything and more that Evernote does plus I can type up a note on my computer and pick up where I left off on my iPhone and iPad! ONEnote syncs everywhere and I have tons of backup space! I can create notes, insert pics, files, music, audio clips, videos etc! I love it! It's Evernote plus more! Awesome application!"
:)
The game keeps crashing FIX IT!!!!!
Excellent application
Great!! I was able to call family abroad for almost 1 hr . Good reception.
I haven't used it much and don't know what it looks like on the other end but so far I like it. I'm going to send myself a copy.
Nice
An Ad network connection in Pro? Apparently has ad network connections inPro:( Has problems with poor internet connection. Hangs up.
"This app is invaluable for capturing meeting notes - specifically flip chart or white board notes from business meetings. This aids in getting accurate, timely follow up to my clients."
I love it it's way better then the regular twitter app and it also attracts more followers I got 10 new followers having this thing it's amazing
"I updated it... But this update made the game crash when I want to play a race.Please update it again, double check if the update works very well for the app. And please, don't fail SEGA. :|"
No Music? I've tried reinstalling multiple times on a few different devices but there's No Soundtrack.
Oneplus 2 The best app for twitter nice
Talking to family in Czech Republic from US and worked fine...:).
Worth the money Excellent twitter client.
Clear signal. No issues with Europe Wi-Fi.
"Many ways to access your notes I like one note because I can create notes at home, at work, on the tablet or on the phone and have access to it anywhere(comes with office 2010 or as a free download.  My old phone was win mobile 6 and it had a notes feature but the file format is not compatible with anything. If you have win 7 you can print to one note but so far win 8 does not have the printer installed I wish ms would fix this. There are 3rd party apps but if it was a printer it could be printed to by more than web browsers!"
Will not allow status updates to be posted to FB even with all permissions set and always crashes.
"Perfection! I love this app!! Finally coughed up the most amount of dough I've ever spent on an app for the pro version and it was more than worth it! Best Twitter client ever! Not to mention the only one I've ever used with a full ""interactions"" page and not just mentions and DMs."
Great app. A very good app. Works well. I like it. Try it and you will like it too.
"Fantastic! freezes constantly, rendering the app useless."
Excellent app
S5 Issues Options/Settings aren't available on Galaxy S5. Any reasons why?
Im+pro Love this app
Good Very good app. Nothing in this world is perfect though.
Amazing and flawless app
App needs to be updated to be standard. :/
TweetCaster Sloppy interface! I absolutely HATE the fact that your followers' profile names don't highlight automatically. This forces the user to HAVE TO remember every url if they want to send a mention. This is terrible because most people FREQUENTLY change these names!
Does not work well with iOS 9. Hope and update is coming soon.
I survived in Japan with Viber.
I use this application over a year ago I communicate with my relatives and friends in Colombia all day
The only one I use It is verry good app. I use it daily. Thanks
Love it! Does what it's supposed to do and I love the dark background.
"ArashI like viber, and will call friend to it!"
Tnx
"3 months later, still no iPhone 5 support.  Clearly a crippled version of OneNote.  Want to indent, create numbered lists, or format text?  Sorry, you need to buy a Windows Phone for that.  The message is clear:  iPhone users, you're second-class citizens with OneNote.  Stick to Evernote or any other note-taking app that doesn't suffer from conflicts of interest."
A very great App !!
"It works well on my HTC Inspire 4G, a very nice app"
Facebook login results in a page not found.
Awesome Its so cool
I like it because It helps us to contact my friend easily
"This game is really fun! When you get the app, shut off your device and turn it back on because then it never crashes anymore! The controls are really good, I love the tracks and everything! It's so fun to play!;)"
"good quality of voice, may add lots of prime features"
Good app
"Another interesting and entertaining idea from the developer of the endless game Crossy Road. Just one recommendation for the developer - please add more power slots, as just 3 is too limited. I will add the fifth star when, hopefully, more power slots are added. Thank you."
Good job.
"I use it to make off versions of hires images to email, and synced checklists with my wife."
"What it does, it does fine. It needs notifications and in-line photo display, though."
Great app Very convenient
Shuts down phone I like this app the beat but after agood recent update it restarts my phone if im on too long.
"I love this app more than anything in my phone.i capture everything that i do on a daily basis and keep my notes synced in Skydrive. When my colleagues needs something, I just email them a page from my note and it goes to them in a neat PDF document which is so cool..I don't know if I can ever get away from this app or I could get something similar ever.."
Best app ever... Thank you
Good to have hooked on to viber. Very good communication App.
Great scanner app for small jobs.
"Love this app as my boyfriend is in Hong Kong. Saving us a lot of money! I would love if this app would allow for me to change ringtones. You also can't share a file and message in the same text. Copy and paste features aren't available, etc. can't wait for future iterations."
OK. Needs to be faster to play
"This is a ghost app! Doesn't really work! No support for a stylus, can't even enter details on a ask the community support page. It think its just a super sized iPhone app for reading onenote files created elsewhere."
My trends won't update or show at all and I wish there were more themes. Other than that it's great though.
TweetCaster
"OneNote helps me organize my notes by topic. I especially love it because I can create and access all of my notes from my iPhone, my Kindle fire, and my laptop. And dictating notes on my iPhone is icing on the cake."
I couldnt even finish one race without it crashing! And it seems like a really good game too. Please fix this ASAP! And then it will have 5 stars :)
My number 1 application
"Hi, The new update has problems. When i open a contact to msg him, the keyboard is open but letters are all blank, and it shuts down by it self."
It'5 fun r8 fiv3 $tars
Works for me just fine 👍
"The app is cool, I can easily type anywhere, draw anywhere. Please add an image resize and a tool to move the text around and resize the drawings around. Over all, this is an awesome app!"
I like it a lot .
Error code 80004005 Not running due to this error. It occurred while retrieving notes from already created account.
I like it
"I love the game! And I LOVE sonic. Mostly shadow but is it me or when the screen is kinda far from egg face, he does magic and makes his arms MAGICLY DISSAPEER OHH AHH but other than that awesome game! Keep it up Sega!"
"Fix the bugs, and you've got a 5 star app. I like you can update multiple twitter accounts, FB all at once"
Years with smart phones and I finally found the perfect notes app
Thank you for your best services
Good app
Mine says could not authenticate with OAuth idk what it means. Anybody could help me? Find me @XYZ
This is the best free up.
I loved it although am facing a problem with sending direct masseges
Google Keep Is Far Better Than This Shit I Understand That You Are King Of Pc's OS But Android Is Not Where You Meant To Be
Very good app no complaints allows me to talk overseas to my kids whenever for free and it's pretty clear
"I have been a daily Skype user for years. Could not live without it either at home or at work. Just discovered Viber and found that a lot of my friends found it ahead of me! I was astonished at how easy the set up was, and the call quality is great. Skype still has many more features, more ability to customize, etc. but I'm sure this is all coming with Viber. I am not giving up on Skype, especially since I use it from my computer at work most of the time, but Viber is a great new addition to the communications suite."
"It's saves you money and helps to be close to your loved one when you are away. I use DID Groundwire app, Skype, Google Voice and few other apps and services when travel in Europe or Asia. Viber works better then all of them. EZ to call and text. Only minus- no video calls..."
"Pretty great app, when in a tweet and I tag a friend in it, their twitter name never comes up... Highly annoying"
Very good and wonderful program
Great
The best without the Ads
"AAA+++I have NEVER experiencing something like VIBER before!! The sound Quality it's like the person over seas was like seating next to me!!!I'm amazing, thank you so much VIBER!!!!"
"I like it a lot even though the communication is broken, it is an excellent tool."
"Superb, mind blowing. Wish it could be used on old Nokia phones (currently have SMS platform only)."
Syncs well
"I like the game but it keeps on crashing every 5, 6, 7, minutes.Please fix this problem, it is anoying"
"Update just broke the app Use it daily but maybe not anymore, the update just bricked the app."
pacman good
I like it. The new update is so good to work with.
It's pretty good compared to the real Twitter
It doesn't start at the last tweet viewed Its a good app byt evrytime I opened it starts at the last tweet posted not at the last tweetd I viewed.  Its annoying cause I missed all the previous tweets that I didnt see. Please fix that
It's excellent.the service is too good.its a blessing in disguise
"I've been using this onenote for 5 years in my desktop. When the app came out for Ipad, i wasn't impressed so i tried other apps. But when i tried this updated onenote, i was totally hooked again and i think i'll be sticking with this one. Good job guys!"
Dope shizz my nizz Use it on all devices.
Nice Every day must have app
The mobile version got me to finally begin using onenote! Excellent all storage facility
Performs as expected. The layout works well on a mobile device. Syncs well with all other versions on desktop and mobile devices. I recommend OneNote without any reservations.
Cant post to my facebook Can connect to my facebook updates! Fix
Only app getting worse. Now has popups for a candy game that takes you from a tweet to the app store. Stalls every time  you write a tweet. Trying to keep it for the zip feature but its getting ridiculous.
Almost perfect
Excellent quality on wifi as well as cellular data. Must have app for smartphones.
Title says all.
Great program and ability to sync it across all my devices makes it my favorite
"
The best thing is that your contacts are already synchronized and ready to talk"
Amazing game! I can't stop playing
Won't even work because it can't authenticate my account? What does that even mean. So annoyed
Let's say that this is the best game/app EVER i liked it ever since i was a kid and now here it is with good quality and everything .. In love
"Wasted $5! Can't compose a tweet, the app crashes and does not work. Allows you to read tweets but I can't tweet myself. It was a total waste of money and now I will have to download another app just to be able to tweet. Very disappointed."
Cool game
"I do not have any problems with this game, plus it's free!"
I love that all of my information is linked seamlessly from device to device.  This app version is very user friendly.
Yes its reall really awesome
Good for stress relief
Awesome fun and addictive
V nice
Add push notification!
"Great App but need save to sd ability The ability to create a searchable notebook that I could add photos and drawing to was perfect. However. As you can't transfer information without using onedrive has rendered this app useless. My workplace deals with sensitive information and prohibits use of external servers such as onedrive etc. If the app was able to save to my phones sd, I could manually transfer the file across to my work pc. It truely is the best notebook app that I am unable to used."
Viber was the one the best social app ever but there is problem for iPhone 6 plus...Please optimize this app for iPhone 6 plus.
Really good
Thank you for this app Please support notifications on ipad and mute Arabic words
Crashes The latest update causes a lot of forced closes for me. Never experienced this before in the years that I had this app. Please fix.
this is a great free calling and texting app. I use it to talk to my father overseas as well as with my girl in any situation. The text feature rocks right along with the video chat feature. it's a must get app!👌👍
"As a student with limited scanner access, this is the best app imaginable. Fast and easy!"
Every time I start a race it crashes
Good
Great app!
Good viber
Samsung galaxy 4s Awesome
"ZERO If I could give zero, then YOU DESERVE IT! cuz who give you the permission to connect MY TWITTER WITH FACEBOOK.  the problem is that you didn't even ask my permission, yet asdfghjkl connecting it between both!?  That's totally over crossed the line of people's privacy! 3:("
"I opened the iPhone version this morning.  It reminded me to upgrade to the iPad version, which as the prior reviewer noted correctly isn't available.  Pretty good odd it is coming soon given this message.  So, where is the Macintosh version of this software?"
Just awesome!!
My boy traveled all over the Middle East and we were able to stay in touch the whole time because of this fantastic app. Calls were so clear. Texts and sending pics worked great! Thank you!
Hello
Its better than skype
Not without flaws (editing) but very useful
I find it much better than uber.
So so at best.  Lots of drops and lots of static
The best Twitter App! Too good to be true. But it is. ^^
It's awesome. Perfect
come back 2 saudia
"Can't sync more than one notebook I didn't expect to take note with it, only to read my notes taken with my computer. But it can only sync one notebook, and that still took forever. And you can't easily export the content of your note either. Very disappointed."
Is it similiar The game is really fun to play but is it similiar to cross road cause that's what I think?
"Truly yes When I enter the apps,missing the tweet"
"I never use a twitter app better that this one! Is awesome, high recommended"
"When you Follow several prolific Twitter accounts, and don't get any updates for days, y'know it's not just you. It's the app. I deleted it and reinstalled and updated once, and stopped soon after. Too bad, this was a great Twitter feed app."
Thank you Finally fixed the Facebook issue. Five stars after a week.
"I was very excited when I saw this app pop up.  It was the one thing that was keeping me from buying an ipad.  But when I finally got logged in, I couldn't see any of my ink, much less anter any free hand content.  This is the power of onenote, and it's completely impotent."
"For the most part, slow sometime though"
Used to be good until the last update. Tried contacting the company for advice and they never responded. Don't use this app and certainly don't spend money on it.
"Amazing app, works perfect with my family and clients around the world!"
Love it Love it! Wish we could view recent pics on twitter profiles though!
"It keeps crashing on me. I'm sure its a great game, but for some reason it wont let me play"
Viber is my life Can make free calls free video messages omg wat will they create again
"Hours of time wasted I spent weeks taking notes on both my laptop and inking on my Note 10.1. In several of my pages, I went back to find that large segments of inked text somehow migrated onto other segments above and below. Unbelievably disappointed. Devistatingly  unreliable."
My girlfriend got this app so we can talk while she was in England. And since I was new to the iPhone it was easy to learn and use. The texting is awesome and fast and the calls work like a charm.
The most recent update improved the speed. Thanks.
This program is more than a refresher
WARNING!! Only tilt mode gimmick available. Will give it another chance when on screen directional Controls make an appearance.
Notifications It's true. Turn off notifications and I was still getting them. It's a pain...
A
Best game ever
FUN! Verry hard
Good Does what it's supposed to do.
Awesome App. I'm in the process of self mastery and all my notes from material that I read goes on One Note. I even have my vision board on One Note as well.
Can some one teach me how this app works
IM + Pro works great. This is a great way to get away from my desktop.
Love it!!
Been using it while traveling back and forth to the Dominican Republic for a couple of years now and have not experienced any issues.
Excellent
A good tool on and offline
Great and very usefull for calling abroad
It's a very useful App that I can't live without any more.
IM+ Excellent all in one IM
This game is really fun! I love it
Better than original
"Now I'm in contact with Russia all the time for no costs!!! So easy to use, that even my parents figure it out! Just love it!!!"
"I love this game. From the start I was hooked, and I played for 3 hours straight. The graphics are great, and this game lived up to my desires. The best part about the game is that it's FREE. This is worth getting."
Very good Great app for tweets
Another update and still no iphone 6 support. Come on.
Was working fine but new version occasionally drops added notes
"I've been looking forward to seeing any MS Office mobile apps for iOS, and onenote is pretty good for the first MS Office app. I really like how it links with office live web apps which can be synced with the onenote desktop app. I can't wait until MS makes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint."
"Overheating too much yes, this is the best twitter client so far but new features of 'Who retweeted this' should not be changed, beforehand we don't have to go to the link for that features  one more thing profile viewer features of more than one profile please make updated version just like usual. Other else, it overheated too much and many advertisements please look into this. Anything else is perfect make it more smooth u r the best among all"
"There's times it has good quality but theres also poor quality and the echo is really bad, you can only hear yourself talking but it fixes the problem when you disconnect/end call and reconnect again/call."
"Pretty good Has trouble with Vines and doesn't display quoted tweets in line (normally), but I still prefer it over the twitter app"
very useful and cost effective especially if u have to make international calls
what's happening not conmecting to twitter server for few days now
Best game ever
Excellent tool for tweeting Organizes my thoughts and allows me to quickly share them with others.  I use this the majority of the time vs. my pc.
"After using Tweetcaster for a couple years I had an issue for several months where it adamantly refused to let me even log in to my Facebook, nevermind trying to post to it. I switched to Hootsuite and lost a couple features for stability. Elected to try this one again and all was mostly well, but now I can't view pictures in the timeline anymore. If I click on them it opens Safari, and unless I log in there I can't view my friends' pics if their account is private (which most are). Very irritating. Looks like I'm going back to Hootsuite, at least for now."
Couldn't ask for a better twitter app!
Wonderful 😊
Awesome and very much helpful
Good Great game
etails It does not allow to use the keyboard when the PEN is extracted from a Samsung Note tablet. I do not understand why they do not implement simple and functional details like the ability to share a note or select the entire note to copy it to the clipboard? It is a very good tool but there are some simple things that would make it match the competition ... another is the creation of the sections from the Android client ...
"Easy to use, highly recommend"
"Great Very useful for keeping track of all sorts and in one document and, available on all devices"
I love OneNote and use it across my devices.  The user experience on my phone is almost as fast as a native app and feels great to use.
"Add ms. Pacman, and miru from PAC AND PAL."
I LOVE IT! Good memories of this old game and love the new angle and some new characters like Glitchy.
"Won't let me retweet a person with a private account. Besides that, everything is good"
This would be the beat twitter app o it didn't crash so often and if you could get it to post to Facebook but most o the time there is trouble. I love it when it works and cuss it most of the time because it doesn't. Also the support from onelouder is terrible. They always say to uninstall & reinstall. Done that 3 times!!!
Worked from Africa!
"Downhill Brilliant client, great support"
Easy to use. Quality scans and provides almost all the controls you could want. My only suggestion is to offer an option of exporting as different format such as jpg
"I would give the original 5 stars! I relied on this app to sync ALL MY COLLEGE NOTES from office 365 and it fails to load any of them now, the original ios onenote worked flawlesdly for je. Microsoft please release an update to allow us to revert back to the original or fix this broken app. Absolutely unacceptable."
Love the call quality of this app......works really great...
"I would love this if it gave me notifications like echofon did. Like when somebody faved my tweet, etc."
"It's gotten worse As other reviewers have said recent updates have turned this formerly outstanding app into a crash mobile.  I'm using another app until it's fixed.  HootSuite is ok, but Tweetcaster should be better.   Right now, it's not."
Whatever PAC man
"Crashes when I open it & terrible lag I've used this app for over 2 yrs & have loved it until now. Every time I try to reply to someone the app closes. Also, the lag is terrible. This has been the best app until lately."
Poop
Great game!
"Quality of calls varies sometimes but is usually pretty good, even when the signal I poor though I can still communicate easily. Solid app."
Great experience with this app. Connects right back with an interrupted call. Pleasure to use. Thank you viber!
"Does not work on my LG G4, crashes on the OneNote logo screen Keep trying Microsoft,  sad to see a great app not run well on Android"
It's fun but they are a few things that I would change. The upgrades take forever.
Wow Nice game
Awesome! Does just what it says!
Worthless if I can't sync FB.
"Loud and clear sound, great!"
"It works perfect except when I'm out of country, then I need good wifi. But I can't really complain, the fact that I can talk to my family oversea for free is priceless."
Love it
User friendly
Great handling multiple accounts... and more TweetCaster is great for handling multiple accounts across multiple devices. Long time Twitter user.  Long time TweetCaster user. Very functional.
Nice Not a bad little app
"Very good quality, saves you money over those paying phone cards that rip you off"
"I love Viber, x through this application I can communicate with my family and friends, Thanks Viber,."
Excellent app for college students!
Great for lectures!!
Don't Update Every update makes it worse.
Awesome Best game ever
"I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the annoying Sticker notifications.Sometimes I open The software in a hurry, thinking that I have missed calls, while in fact it was only sticker notifications. Fix this and I will give it five stars."
"Super app call quality is excellent even in poor connections, thumps up."
It is good for calling international good service and free what else we need
"This looks like it could be a good game, IF you can get it to run, and keep it running. It failed to load past the SEGA screen on iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G, and crashes for no apparent  reason on generation 1 iPad. All running iOS 5.1.1"
So like it
Great way to talk to family overseas!
Nice apps I ever had It very handy & very usefull....vslue 4 money...
"I actually love this app but it crashes and kicks you off at times. I use TweetCaster for iPad so maybe that's why because they recently put the iPad version out. Anyhow they ate working on it and tech reps do send me updates all the time. Other then that, this app is fantastic.. I would have given 5stars if it was not kicking me off but 4 stars are good enough for right now. Hopefully you guys fix these minor issues. Thanx"
Love it!! Very user friendly!! Great app! :)
Good product. Worth it! Ok
International airline pilot...just used for first time to call wife back in the states from Australia...worked great...excellent sound quality with no interruptions...highly recommend
Great for overseas!
"great app and i use it a lot, but when someone send his location to me and i try to open it in Maps App, i can see different in location!!!please correct it ...i try it on iPad 2, iPhone 4 , ?Galaxy S and the same problemAlso, there is no iPad version. And this problem is for any communication program in the store!!"
Great game
Cool
Awesome!!!
Great app Very easy to use!
tweetcaster I could give it mire but it's slow and always closes!!!
Getting connected with my family over seas for free!!! Thank you Viber!
Not good as I expected My yahoo photo of the account doesn't appear... Profile photo of some contacts doesnt appear... Thanks for all the rest and notification for the online contacts doesn't work
cant play wen finish downloaded it keep on crashing
Awesome It is so endless
"Hate it Worked well until the last update, now it crashes constantly and refuses to download images without crashing. I've uninstalled..."
"Post later In general I think the app is ugly and cluttered however it always works. Except I'm having an issue with sending tweets that are posted for later. Somehow the app changes the time,  for example I want a tweet sent at 1115, it has changed it to ever time except that one. It's been doing this for a few weeks."
Tons of great features!
"My ballet buddy Mia and I can't call each other cuz we can't hear each other when we call, u really need to fix that, I would give viber a for sure 3 star rating!!!"
"Bad Laptop/ desktop version is awesome , both for Mac and Windows,  but this ? Wtf"
Re-sets phone New update keeps causing my phone to re-set. A shame because I like the app. Any plans to resolve this issue?
"Good , very clear  , itried inside egypt"
Freezes a lot and only allows so many followings per hour!
Great app
Nice
I am in the UK and I love this app! And it is saving me money.
Awesomeness
Just started using this app for classes. Has awesome features and helps me stay very organized.  Great for quit notes and editing.
Calls & messages are unavailable. Having this error since last 3 days :(
"My wife and I share business and personal notebooks across our iPhones, iPads and MacBooks. I love that I can keep track of notes on all devices and that we can collaborate at the same time on documents. The familiar binder style is easy to organize and utilize. I never could get into Evernote, but am completely devoted to OneNote."
"Soo much more convenient than the slow scanner on my computer. And, I can sign important docs and send on the go now!!! Awesome idea and awesome app!!!"
Best app in the world !!!!!
"It worked great on my iPhone 5 with iOS 7. Then I upgraded the iOS eight on my iPhone 5. Now I bought an iPhone six running iOS 8. It installed fine. However, it won't let me sign on.it doesn't send me an access code."
Works for me Does what it's supposed to do ...
This game is beast
"I don't see how Anyone can live without it. Great app!  Photos, location, free calls worldwide, freeze SMS worldwide. What's not to love?"
messed up This app is pretty awesome but you made that blue bar way too big one star until you fix uninstalling and reinstalling previous version
Excellent
