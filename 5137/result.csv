Ppl!! It's terrific! Love it,useless
Great game. It crashes a lot but I can usually still do time trials missions and solo races. And everyone needs to stop saying to fix it ASAP. It's not that easy of a thing to fix.,useful
"S5 & Surface Pro2 user Love this on PC, but cannot get it to sync with android. Will delete if this doesn't get fixed soon!",useful
"This is a home run from Microsoft in business productivity apps very long after their Office suite. Only been using for a week but does everything I need, except being able to draw on an iPad (hence 4 stars). Maybe they also include handwriting to text and audio notes, but that might take away they simplicity in usage.",useful
Encrypted pages are not supported. Encrypted notebooks are not supported.,useful
Best apps 10/10,useless
It works so far!,useless
"Even with service, it'll still fail to send tweets. Fix yourself.",useful
Made my first call with the app. Worked perfectly.,useless
"If you use Mac OS X and iOS mobile, this is the best app for functionality And features. integration across devices is better. It's more intuitive than Evernote.",useful
"Only one gripe I only have one gripe with the app in that you can't tell whether someone has RTed or Favourited your tweet without going into separate menus, I like to have all mention/RT/Fave notifications in one place together. Unless I'm being absolutely stupid, in which cade feel free to correct me, that is the only thing stopping me awarding it 5 stars.",useful
Screen downsized?? Too Much screen at top now being used!!    Dislike a lot,useful
Pacman Its awsome,useless
Great old school look with a touch of new features,useless
This app is amazing!! Especially for all you college students which I'm one of those myself. I love this app because when I'm at home I access my notes from my iPad and when I'm at school and forget my iPad I always have my phone so I can literally take notes on my phone and they will appear on my iPad!!,useful
"Great app but how am I supposed to know when someone tweets me if I am not notified when I have a tweet? The app NEEDS a ringtone of some sort when I'm not using the app and my phone is locked, or I'm in another app.",useful
Arabic language is not supported  The characters appear separated and in the right (FALSE) direction    Please Fix that!,useful
Its ok not the best app,useless
Wow its so nice app...,useless
Can't access settings or feedback What good is an application if you can't change the settings or send feedback through it? I have the same problem with office lens. Typical arrogant Microsoft.,useful
Awsome,useless
"I just started using Viber. The connection wasn't clear all the time, and I got disconnected once. I plan to keep using it regularly and will come back to make additional comments.",useful
Has gotten better over the years But the widget needs some love. I wish it showed all 140 characters.,useful
It's good but If I received a local call i lose Viber connection. I will gave 4 stars,useful
Great for messaging but voice quality issues at times need to b corrected.,useful
This works on a limited basis.  Works well for retrieval of notes and is ok with entry of notes.  Ability to handwrite notes would be great and handwriting recognition would be incredible.  I would pay for an iPad app with more functionality but this works fine for free.,useful
viber very good,useless
It is very awesome !! Thank you so much.,useless
It would even b better if we can have the choice to add our friends on viber rather than have them all on the list at setup.,useless
"This is a really good app so far. The phone calls are clear most of the time. Better than sprint provider. I have to pay for sprint calls and calls are echo-ey and can hear others conversations some times! Keep it up, Viber!",useful
Best program for Twitter This has been the best program I've ever used for Twitter. Tech support is quick and helpful.,useful
"I've been looking for a simple and cheap way to call cellphones in other countries for many years.. Viber made my day! The only thing, I use it with my iPad quite often and since it's not optimized for the ipad display it looks a bit cheap on an ipad. maybe you can make it universal or add an HD version?",useful
i like the game when it lets me play but mostly all the time it just kicks me out of the game and goes back to my home-screen!!!! IT NEEDS A FIX BIG TIME!!!!!!!ðŸ˜­,useful

Couldn't stay organized without it,useless
Love it. Does what it does and does it well.,useless

"Just made my first viber call to a friend in London on her way to Brighton in a bus. She's got a British number. The quality was absolutely OUTSTANDING. We were both totally amazed.  Much better than google voice, which I also use. If more of my friends used viber, I would ditch my cell plan altogether.",useful
Great app.  Love that I can scan several different items and it creates a PDF.,useless
"Does not want to sync, or takes forever The App works fine by itself, but if you want to sync with anything. good luck. takes hours on wifi and even then majority of the time AND then decides to error out. has been re-installed multiple times, on Android 4.4 up to recent 5.",useful
"This app was recommended to me by my boss to send information more efficiently, its saves me time off my already busy work shift. I love it.",useful
I cannot get it to work. I get an error message and cannot view my timeline or anything. Please fix!,useful
Fun fun fun This game is great,useless

Excellent app,useless
"i have a ipad 1 also and it crashes a lot too. but they are going to make an update as soon as possible so calm down! i got to play atleast the first race so far , and it looks like a great game ! dont judge a book by its cover :c",useful
Need to add more stuff Some of the stuff don't work,useless
"Unusable now Loved this app and been using since long time, but suddenly I can't load more tweets, just shows last 1hr or so tweets. This is unusable now. Switching to some other app.",useful
"This app is great! I can talk to friends all over the world for free!!! Sound quality is usually pretty good, however, this does depend on how much signal you are getting at the time. I've only had a few dropped calls and it was because I lost service. I use it both on 3G and wifi. Great product!",useful
In Freetown; Sierra Leone best way to stay in touch with my family in the USA.Thank you Viber,useless
MS you must have an authentication problem between live I'd and iPhone with the onenote server.  I use onenote at my office with 2010 version an was hoping to view my notes.  I also use microsoftonline exchange on my iPhone with no issues.  You should include one note with exchange as well. Then you would have something,useful
"Painfully slow Can take up to a minute for the splash screen to go, the app is crashing a lot, takes ages to load up users profiles. This was my favourite app - but I've gone back to their Slices app (which runs at lightening speed)",useful
I would love to know what the game is like. It crashes before starting a race. Wasted money.,useful
It's the best note taking app of all time. Get it.,useless
I've used this app for quite some time on both iPad and iPhone. What I've noticed lately; use the internal browser-crash. Search for a user-crash. Doesn't save your place in the timeline. You guys are going downhill fast. GYST,useful
It's even better than the windows phone app!,useless
"Pdurham Latest update made mentions unusable. No text, only links and hashtags. Now the ""retweet of me"" button doesn't show who retweeted you. Sliding downhill.",useful
"This app is wonderful! Quite a lifesaver. Trustworthy, easy to use, and seems to work wonderfully!! Saved us a ton of money also.",useless
Garbage Signed in and it promptly crashes and signs me right out. Not even worth the download time. You would think with all of Microsoft ' s money they could find app developers to actually make an app that is stable and works.,useful
I am having problem with viber connection line stableing it. when i switch on viber it take so much time to connecting it say viber is connecting then it take 10 sec to establish the line where as other hand iphone 4s don't have this problem.Please fix this issue comeing next new viber update,useful
"The best note app, organizing your note with notebook, sections, pages , and subpages; A lot of text editing function, including adding link to your own paragraphs. But this app for phone is not as good as  that for Mac, less multimedia function than Evernote for phone.",useful
"If you upgrade your power-ups to level 8, you will not be able to add them to your current loadout. Quite a large bug to miss.",useful
"I wish I could disable the splash screen, but aside from that it does pretty much everything I want except inline translations.",useful

Excellent Brilliant program.,useless
The game crashes every time you are gonna get in a race. How can you put in the store a program that doesn't work? And how does apple allows it?,useful

I love this app it's very easy to navigate through.,useful
"I've had this app for months, and thought the timeline presentation and overall usage was fantastic.  This all changed today, when a banner advertisement completely caused the entire thing to crash by repeatedly opening the moment I activated the app.  I'm done with this crap.",useful
Best game 4lyfe,useless
"Awesome app that I use to take note for school. However, the app for Mac cannot have as many functions as for PC. I wish I could draw in One Note in Mac like in PC. The app sync note to iPhone take somewhat a much longer time than in Mac and PC. But it is such a great app already",useful
With iPhone 5 works just perfectly,useless

Everybody got this app Super cool,useless
i need i go it and i love it,useless
"Ok I load it and they make me Follow them. Then it is impossible to figure out how to unfollow them.Then I try to send a link of an article. My link is in there but the subject line is:Check out this link from TweetCaster!And inside the email only my link, no title and more promoting them. I'm not going to send that email. I already paid you guys 4.99 for your App. So can't you give me a service instead of forcing me to send out advertising for you??So I got this hoping to find and App that would show me a threaded conversation. Maybe one tweet. Not clear.",useful
Good service although sometimes the call service is cut,useful

Good app But I need voice call via wifi,useless
"Interactions section doesn't load automatically, and the option to tweet music fails to work properly as well. Crashes occasionally, but that's to be expected with any app. Notifications are at the top of my wishlist, though. Otherwise, great app that works 95% of the time",useful
I have been using onenote since 2006 and it's great to see it expand to be useful in many circumstances,useful
This game is neat,useless
Reccomended for international calls!,useful
"After using this app for about a year (it was the best of the worst!) I have to say it still is pretty awful. It used to crash upon opening. Now it crashes when I try to send a tweet. I've updated, redownloaded, restarted....tried everything and it's still not working. I've been through 3 different phones so it's not the hardware. Deleting it and NOT redownloading again!",useful
I really am very happy with it,useless
Very useful.,useless

I think it's an excellent program. I recommend it,useless
I'm using evernote and want to try the other Crashed went start. Asus Zen 5 :(,useful
The is one of the most useful applications ever built.  Everytime I show someone the app and they start to use it I learn more about it from them.  About 50% of the people I show now use this app daily!  App is constantly getting improvements as well!,useful
Love this App and the friendly design. One of the best Twitter Apps on the market.,useless
"Nice Finally a company decided to make another version of pacman. Unfortunately, it lags at times but it's vary good. My question is: Is there a global leaderbored? If there isn't then my advise is to add it. This is probably better than all of the pacman games out there.",useful

Awesome,useless
Perfect Works perfect for me.,useless
"Utter rubbish, do not update If I could give this minus stars I would. The only reason I updated was the version I had installed had rabies (or something). This new version is worse. Will do nothing. Can't post, refresh anything without error msgs. Worst update yet. Oh and also v annoyed at google demanding I have a g+ account so I can post this review. You both totally suck, is the most polite thing I can say on these matters. Xperia pro",useful
Best Twitter Application I've Used,useless
I love this application. Works great.,useless
"When this app first came out, it was very meh, but they keep adding more features and now this app is my go to for note taking and studying",useful

"It's ok. If you're going to charge for an app, working notifications would be nice.",useless
Love this app. The sound quality of the calls are better than my actual phone calls. I am really pleased with this app.,useful
Is this actually a fun game? I wouldn't know cuz the dumb thing keeps on crashing before I play! You guys need to update this!!!! It doesn't even deserve this one star.,useful
This has to be my favorite game yet! So not a waste of money! It's great! So much fun!,useless

You have no idea how i love this app...thank you.,useless
Good game,useless
Very good,useless
"Good, dodgy credits Sometimes  it says i am out of  credits when i have 30...",useful
"Pac-Man 256 is now one of my favorite games ever. It brings a fresh twist to the classic, such an example being power-ups. What many people forget to mention is the fact that you can play without credits, but you can't use power-ups. Bringing Sue, funky, and Funky back from the - erm, dead - was a great idea. While not all the physics are 1 to 1 true to the original Pac-Man, it is one of the things that makes Pac-Man 256 special. It's great, fun, free, and always a good source to waste time. After 35 years, Pac-Man is STILL surprising me. The creators of Crossy Road did a great job showing a new way to play an old game. If there is just one thing to improve, it would be to add characters to buy with coins, an example being Ms. Pac-Man. Overall, it's a great game for a great gaming icon. Happy biirthday, Pac-Man!",useful
"awesome would like to be notified when someone retweets, follows  or favorites me in the mentions & interaction section then this app would be better then every other twitter app.",useful
Disappointed App force closes when I try to log in. Wish I could use it.,useful

Why are u guys slow with updating the mac versionI still don't have new stickers there!ðŸ˜’,useful
"Phenomenal!One of my most used apps. I have many friends and family overseas and Viber gives us the opportunity to stay in touch easily. I have found that most of the time our phone conversations are so much more clear than using a regular phone line. On the odd occasion, the line breaks up a little, but usually a redial can fix that.Love this App!!",useful
Excellent It's so convenient & connection during calls is excellent.,useful

"There's a slew of note applications; however, this is one that's well implemented and it's actually supported by a large corporation, so it's not going to reach an end of life in 12-24 months. The interface is simple and clean but when you realize the depth of tracking you have with note tabs, individual listings under each tab, and synchronization across every mobile and either PC or Mac, you can't beat it! Elegant, fluid, fast, stable, organized, simple.",useful
This App is one id the best out there,useless
Interesting... Good Job,useless
"A great apps to keep connect people from all over the world, not just messaging but voice too.",useless
Sweet and sophisticated,useless
Great portable version Two thumbs up.,useless
"It says there's an error that I am at my limit of 350 requests per hour.  Seriously?  I haven't used it in a few days yet am at a limit and when I DO use it, I post one or two tweets. Apparently this is an issue with this app.",useful

"Great VoIP app. Works as advertised. Only complaint would be the app runs a bit sluggish, for example during launch or switching between tabs and conversations. Otherwise great audio quality, even on mobile data. Basically phone like once on wifi. Must get app.",useful
Outstandingly better than original twitter app,useless
I like it very much+++++++++++++++++,useless
"I've been waiting for this app for a long time. I love the pc version of Onenote, but needed something more suited to a mobile device. Unfortunately, I haven't been won back from Evernote. I haven't had the problems everyone is talking about, but sadly, some needed features are missing. While I really like being able to make check and bullet lists, not to mention putting in pictures, it's too little too late. If not being able to search within your notes (including text in images like you can on the pc version) is disappointing, than the complete lack of any search feature is a disaster. I'll keep the app for now and hope for updates, but hey, I'm writing this review in Evernote because I know I'll be able to find it later that way. I'll give three stars for rich text editing, but you have to do better than that. Now if due dates could be attached to check boxes, that would be awesome...",useful
"Worth the price! I like the simplicity of the integration and the push mode features, status in push mode for days.   Only 4 stars because there are few issues to be ironed out.",useful
Same glitches over iPhone and Android One thing that I hate are apps that aim to be professional but miss some important issues big time. This app has a constant problem connecting to my skype account. IM+ keeps trying and trying without any luck. Annoying and frustrating. Same thing I experienced with my former iPhone 3GS and now it's happening again on my Galaxy Nexus running ICS 4.0.2. I reverted to using the free imo.im without any issues.,useful
Love it.,useless
"I run GTD on my iPhone using the one note app, and it is essential to the way I run my business.  In my opinion, there is absolutely no replacement. It seamlessly links to all of the notes I have on my laptop, it smoothly represents any handwritten notes I have, and it allows me to update or add any additional information to any notes I already have on my phone. This allows me to input current to-do'sthat come to mind in the field, it also allows me to reference any to-do's I have already included in my Onenote set up at home. It is basically the Holy Grail of seamlessly using GTD in a mobile setting.   The app is quick, easy to use, and I have never had a problem with it backing up or losing any information over the last year and a half that I've been using it. A clear and easy five star rating.",useful
"to make international calls, or text, nothing beats this app from what I have seen!  I even like it for calls within the U.S. because the voice quality is so good.  Sometimes, the connection is poor, and occasionally calls are dropped, however, when weighed against the big phone providers, it is no different then those services.  a real money saver ...for sure",useful
Easy to use. Effective. I would recommend it.,useless
Very nice,useless
"I can finally zoom into my notes with the new major update today. Microsoft, Kudos, for once you have not charged for the next version.",useful
