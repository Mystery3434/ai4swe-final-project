Interaction takes ages to load,1
Ppl!! It's terrific! Love it,0
Great game. It crashes a lot but I can usually still do time trials missions and solo races. And everyone needs to stop saying to fix it ASAP. It's not that easy of a thing to fix.,1
"S5 & Surface Pro2 user Love this on PC, but cannot get it to sync with android. Will delete if this doesn't get fixed soon!",1
"This is a home run from Microsoft in business productivity apps very long after their Office suite. Only been using for a week but does everything I need, except being able to draw on an iPad (hence 4 stars). Maybe they also include handwriting to text and audio notes, but that might take away they simplicity in usage.",1
Encrypted pages are not supported. Encrypted notebooks are not supported.,1
Best apps 10/10,0
It works so far!,0
"Even with service, it'll still fail to send tweets. Fix yourself.",0
Made my first call with the app. Worked perfectly.,0
"If you use Mac OS X and iOS mobile, this is the best app for functionality And features. integration across devices is better. It's more intuitive than Evernote.",1
"Only one gripe I only have one gripe with the app in that you can't tell whether someone has RTed or Favourited your tweet without going into separate menus, I like to have all mention/RT/Fave notifications in one place together. Unless I'm being absolutely stupid, in which cade feel free to correct me, that is the only thing stopping me awarding it 5 stars.",1
Screen downsized?? Too Much screen at top now being used!!    Dislike a lot,1
Pacman Its awsome,0
Great old school look with a touch of new features,0
This app is amazing!! Especially for all you college students which I'm one of those myself. I love this app because when I'm at home I access my notes from my iPad and when I'm at school and forget my iPad I always have my phone so I can literally take notes on my phone and they will appear on my iPad!!,0
"Great app but how am I supposed to know when someone tweets me if I am not notified when I have a tweet? The app NEEDS a ringtone of some sort when I'm not using the app and my phone is locked, or I'm in another app.",1
Arabic language is not supported  The characters appear separated and in the right (FALSE) direction    Please Fix that!,1
Its ok not the best app,0
Wow its so nice app...,0
Can't access settings or feedback What good is an application if you can't change the settings or send feedback through it? I have the same problem with office lens. Typical arrogant Microsoft.,1
Awsome,0
"I just started using Viber. The connection wasn't clear all the time, and I got disconnected once. I plan to keep using it regularly and will come back to make additional comments.",1
Has gotten better over the years But the widget needs some love. I wish it showed all 140 characters.,1
It's good but If I received a local call i lose Viber connection. I will gave 4 stars,1
Great for messaging but voice quality issues at times need to b corrected.,1
This works on a limited basis.  Works well for retrieval of notes and is ok with entry of notes.  Ability to handwrite notes would be great and handwriting recognition would be incredible.  I would pay for an iPad app with more functionality but this works fine for free.,1
viber very good,0
It is very awesome !! Thank you so much.,0
It would even b better if we can have the choice to add our friends on viber rather than have them all on the list at setup.,1
"This is a really good app so far. The phone calls are clear most of the time. Better than sprint provider. I have to pay for sprint calls and calls are echo-ey and can hear others conversations some times! Keep it up, Viber!",1
Best program for Twitter This has been the best program I've ever used for Twitter. Tech support is quick and helpful.,1
"I've been looking for a simple and cheap way to call cellphones in other countries for many years.. Viber made my day! The only thing, I use it with my iPad quite often and since it's not optimized for the ipad display it looks a bit cheap on an ipad. maybe you can make it universal or add an HD version?",1
i like the game when it lets me play but mostly all the time it just kicks me out of the game and goes back to my home-screen!!!! IT NEEDS A FIX BIG TIME!!!!!!!ðŸ˜­,1
Tiny scan Great app very simple and helpful,0
GREAT,0
Couldn't stay organized without it,0
Love it. Does what it does and does it well.,0
"Great game! Fun game, my kids love it. I like that me my wife and two kids can play together over WiFi. Daddy always wins, lol daddy has years of experience like Mario kart 64 and GoldenEye 64, which I still play twice a week.Crash racing is a good game as well!",0
When my phone was inoperable this app was an absolute savior!!!,1
How can you get  loud ring.tone. Dorothy Beatty,0
OneNote is an indispensable app. Combine it with OneDrive and you gave a nice workflow. Well done.,1
I have trouble with video call.. Need Help!!,1
ParbejPritu Myself,0
Very nice app. Saves me a bundle. Clear voice and good connections. A must have for all international travelers.,0
If I had a dollar for every time,0
"Just made my first viber call to a friend in London on her way to Brighton in a bus. She's got a British number. The quality was absolutely OUTSTANDING. We were both totally amazed.  Much better than google voice, which I also use. If more of my friends used viber, I would ditch my cell plan altogether.",1
Great app.  Love that I can scan several different items and it creates a PDF.,1
"Does not want to sync, or takes forever The App works fine by itself, but if you want to sync with anything. good luck. takes hours on wifi and even then majority of the time AND then decides to error out. has been re-installed multiple times, on Android 4.4 up to recent 5.",1
"This app was recommended to me by my boss to send information more efficiently, its saves me time off my already busy work shift. I love it.",0
I cannot get it to work. I get an error message and cannot view my timeline or anything. Please fix!,1
Fun fun fun This game is great,0
"New tweet notification I disabled the 'Notify on new tweets', but it keeps giving me notification when there're new tweets in my timeline. Please fix that!",1
"Did work, but when you fix something not broke.... My uncle would have fired you.Go back to old system leave it alone.",0
Excellent app,0
"i have a ipad 1 also and it crashes a lot too. but they are going to make an update as soon as possible so calm down! i got to play atleast the first race so far , and it looks like a great game ! dont judge a book by its cover :c",1
Need to add more stuff Some of the stuff don't work,0
"Unusable now Loved this app and been using since long time, but suddenly I can't load more tweets, just shows last 1hr or so tweets. This is unusable now. Switching to some other app.",1
"This app is great! I can talk to friends all over the world for free!!! Sound quality is usually pretty good, however, this does depend on how much signal you are getting at the time. I've only had a few dropped calls and it was because I lost service. I use it both on 3G and wifi. Great product!",1
In Freetown; Sierra Leone best way to stay in touch with my family in the USA.Thank you Viber,0
MS you must have an authentication problem between live I'd and iPhone with the onenote server.  I use onenote at my office with 2010 version an was hoping to view my notes.  I also use microsoftonline exchange on my iPhone with no issues.  You should include one note with exchange as well. Then you would have something,1
"Painfully slow Can take up to a minute for the splash screen to go, the app is crashing a lot, takes ages to load up users profiles. This was my favourite app - but I've gone back to their Slices app (which runs at lightening speed)",1
I would love to know what the game is like. It crashes before starting a race. Wasted money.,1
It's the best note taking app of all time. Get it.,0
I've used this app for quite some time on both iPad and iPhone. What I've noticed lately; use the internal browser-crash. Search for a user-crash. Doesn't save your place in the timeline. You guys are going downhill fast. GYST,1
It's even better than the windows phone app!,0
"Pdurham Latest update made mentions unusable. No text, only links and hashtags. Now the ""retweet of me"" button doesn't show who retweeted you. Sliding downhill.",1
"This app is wonderful! Quite a lifesaver. Trustworthy, easy to use, and seems to work wonderfully!! Saved us a ton of money also.",1
Garbage Signed in and it promptly crashes and signs me right out. Not even worth the download time. You would think with all of Microsoft ' s money they could find app developers to actually make an app that is stable and works.,1
I am having problem with viber connection line stableing it. when i switch on viber it take so much time to connecting it say viber is connecting then it take 10 sec to establish the line where as other hand iphone 4s don't have this problem.Please fix this issue comeing next new viber update,1
"The best note app, organizing your note with notebook, sections, pages , and subpages; A lot of text editing function, including adding link to your own paragraphs. But this app for phone is not as good as  that for Mac, less multimedia function than Evernote for phone.",1
"If you upgrade your power-ups to level 8, you will not be able to add them to your current loadout. Quite a large bug to miss.",1
"I wish I could disable the splash screen, but aside from that it does pretty much everything I want except inline translations.",1
Way better This way better now 5 stars,0
Thank you viber. We are so grateful,0
It's ok..,0
Awesome app!!!!!saves money!!!,0
"Not perfect, but works!",0
This is the best app..,0
Excellent Brilliant program.,0
The game crashes every time you are gonna get in a race. How can you put in the store a program that doesn't work? And how does apple allows it?,1
Good game Bad thing is that upgrades take along time to take place.,1
Very good app of the best in communication :),0
Quick in access from mobile as well as Mac simultaneously. Very useful especially.,1
Thi is a great apps you guys keep up the good work !!!,0
Preloaded to follow lefties.,0
"Crashed, froze, no good,",1
I love this app it's very easy to navigate through.,0
"I've had this app for months, and thought the timeline presentation and overall usage was fantastic.  This all changed today, when a banner advertisement completely caused the entire thing to crash by repeatedly opening the moment I activated the app.  I'm done with this crap.",1
Best game 4lyfe,0
"Awesome app that I use to take note for school. However, the app for Mac cannot have as many functions as for PC. I wish I could draw in One Note in Mac like in PC. The app sync note to iPhone take somewhat a much longer time than in Mac and PC. But it is such a great app already",1
With iPhone 5 works just perfectly,1
how was i living without this?,0
Everybody got this app Super cool,0
i need i go it and i love it,0
"Ok I load it and they make me Follow them. Then it is impossible to figure out how to unfollow them.Then I try to send a link of an article. My link is in there but the subject line is:Check out this link from TweetCaster!And inside the email only my link, no title and more promoting them. I'm not going to send that email. I already paid you guys 4.99 for your App. So can't you give me a service instead of forcing me to send out advertising for you??So I got this hoping to find and App that would show me a threaded conversation. Maybe one tweet. Not clear.",1
Good service although sometimes the call service is cut,1
Thank you,0
Awesome I love this game it's really cool u should get it,0
Great app,0
Very adicking I played this game for hours my best is 4367,0

Can't live without it now.,0
Great app,0
Its great!!!!,0
"No doubt one of my fav games for free. It's basically Mario kart for free! The game works fine for me, does not crash at all. Get it while it's free!!",1
Please remove this app from app store if it does not support iPhone 5 screen,1
"Thanks a lot for this App, it's useful to my whole family.",0
"Ugh, what happened? I've used it for years and it's generally worked well but the latest update has started using Twitlonger even for short tweets. Switched to another client until this is fixed.",1
Not working.. I open it up and it closes on me. Fix this please!,1
"Crashes at least 5 times a day. Also, lags.",1
This is the one and only and best app ever! Can't live without it!,0
Great..just 2 issues When i push the button to make a tweet it takes forever to come up them im asked to force close or wait.,1
Need to fix images The images even the avatars are not loading on my phone its a LGl38c with net 10 service and I have a unlimited data plan on it and its still not loading the pictures could you please fix this issue I'm extremely dissatisfied because its doing this!,1
Better than Twitter app Decent but gaudy,1
Love it ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ @XYZ,0
It's nice,0
Still background image issue on my iPhone 6!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,1
It's really fun and addicting,0
I use viber every day. It's great!,0
Cool spin on a classic game,0
Love it!,0
Good app But I need voice call via wifi,0
"Interactions section doesn't load automatically, and the option to tweet music fails to work properly as well. Crashes occasionally, but that's to be expected with any app. Notifications are at the top of my wishlist, though. Otherwise, great app that works 95% of the time",1
I have been using onenote since 2006 and it's great to see it expand to be useful in many circumstances,0
This game is neat,0
Reccomended for international calls!,0
"After using this app for about a year (it was the best of the worst!) I have to say it still is pretty awful. It used to crash upon opening. Now it crashes when I try to send a tweet. I've updated, redownloaded, restarted....tried everything and it's still not working. I've been through 3 different phones so it's not the hardware. Deleting it and NOT redownloading again!",1
I really am very happy with it,0
Very useful.,0
"Viber works perfectly. Easy to set up, easy to use, and it performs splendidly. Just set up a couple of days ago and we are talking and texting from continent to continent. Thanks Viber. Jimnet",1
This is allowing our family contact with out daughter who is studying abroad! Works beautifully! Super clear! So happy!!!,1
I think it's an excellent program. I recommend it,0
I'm using evernote and want to try the other Crashed went start. Asus Zen 5 :(,1
The is one of the most useful applications ever built.  Everytime I show someone the app and they start to use it I learn more about it from them.  About 50% of the people I show now use this app daily!  App is constantly getting improvements as well!,0
Love this App and the friendly design. One of the best Twitter Apps on the market.,0
"Nice Finally a company decided to make another version of pacman. Unfortunately, it lags at times but it's vary good. My question is: Is there a global leaderbored? If there isn't then my advise is to add it. This is probably better than all of the pacman games out there.",1
To day very good,0
Finally I found a gr8 solution to call my friend in gulf countries for FREE..u must need wifi or 3G connection for best quality.,1
No twitter app better,0
Impressive implementation of Office's best tool.,0
"I use this for notes, field service notes, follow ups, conference calls, and anything else I can.  Best app for on the go.",1
Awesome,0
Perfect Works perfect for me.,0
"Utter rubbish, do not update If I could give this minus stars I would. The only reason I updated was the version I had installed had rabies (or something). This new version is worse. Will do nothing. Can't post, refresh anything without error msgs. Worst update yet. Oh and also v annoyed at google demanding I have a g+ account so I can post this review. You both totally suck, is the most polite thing I can say on these matters. Xperia pro",1
Best Twitter Application I've Used,0
I love this application. Works great.,0
"When this app first came out, it was very meh, but they keep adding more features and now this app is my go to for note taking and studying",1
Use lots of wireless data in background It took about 400MB cell phone data in 2 days before I found out.,1
"It's ok. If you're going to charge for an app, working notifications would be nice.",0
Love this app. The sound quality of the calls are better than my actual phone calls. I am really pleased with this app.,1
Is this actually a fun game? I wouldn't know cuz the dumb thing keeps on crashing before I play! You guys need to update this!!!! It doesn't even deserve this one star.,1
This has to be my favorite game yet! So not a waste of money! It's great! So much fun!,0
Best twitter app on planet!!!!,0
It works for me I use it to scan and send documents that I have to sign.,1
Cool game like it. Thanks,0
Love this app and would even buy the pro version if it supported push notifications without the use of Boxcar which hardly even works!,1
You have no idea how i love this app...thank you.,0
Good game,0
Very good,0
"Good, dodgy credits Sometimes  it says i am out of  credits when i have 30...",1
"Pac-Man 256 is now one of my favorite games ever. It brings a fresh twist to the classic, such an example being power-ups. What many people forget to mention is the fact that you can play without credits, but you can't use power-ups. Bringing Sue, funky, and Funky back from the - erm, dead - was a great idea. While not all the physics are 1 to 1 true to the original Pac-Man, it is one of the things that makes Pac-Man 256 special. It's great, fun, free, and always a good source to waste time. After 35 years, Pac-Man is STILL surprising me. The creators of Crossy Road did a great job showing a new way to play an old game. If there is just one thing to improve, it would be to add characters to buy with coins, an example being Ms. Pac-Man. Overall, it's a great game for a great gaming icon. Happy biirthday, Pac-Man!",0
"awesome would like to be notified when someone retweets, follows  or favorites me in the mentions & interaction section then this app would be better then every other twitter app.",1
Disappointed App force closes when I try to log in. Wish I could use it.,1
One star for the rate us banner that appears across the middle of the screen during the middle of gameplay. Dick move.,1
"As a small business owner, this app is not only convenient, but works exactly how it says it will. I'm very happy to have this as one of my top apps for productivity!",0
Great!!,0
fun,0
Why are u guys slow with updating the mac versionI still don't have new stickers there!ðŸ˜’,1
"Phenomenal!One of my most used apps. I have many friends and family overseas and Viber gives us the opportunity to stay in touch easily. I have found that most of the time our phone conversations are so much more clear than using a regular phone line. On the odd occasion, the line breaks up a little, but usually a redial can fix that.Love this App!!",0
Excellent It's so convenient & connection during calls is excellent.,1
Follow mee ^___^ ' ; @XYZ,0
Wonderful!,0
"There's a slew of note applications; however, this is one that's well implemented and it's actually supported by a large corporation, so it's not going to reach an end of life in 12-24 months. The interface is simple and clean but when you realize the depth of tracking you have with note tabs, individual listings under each tab, and synchronization across every mobile and either PC or Mac, you can't beat it! Elegant, fluid, fast, stable, organized, simple.",1
This App is one id the best out there,0
Interesting... Good Job,0
"A great apps to keep connect people from all over the world, not just messaging but voice too.",0
Sweet and sophisticated,0
Great portable version Two thumbs up.,0
"It says there's an error that I am at my limit of 350 requests per hour.  Seriously?  I haven't used it in a few days yet am at a limit and when I DO use it, I post one or two tweets. Apparently this is an issue with this app.",1
bad Still not working. keep crashing after login details are entered.,1
"I've had this game since it came out, and I continue to love it, although the new update is experiencing some issues now. Please fix as soon as possible!",1
Well done NAMCO!,0
"Great VoIP app. Works as advertised. Only complaint would be the app runs a bit sluggish, for example during launch or switching between tabs and conversations. Otherwise great audio quality, even on mobile data. Basically phone like once on wifi. Must get app.",1
Outstandingly better than original twitter app,0
I like it very much+++++++++++++++++,0
"I've been waiting for this app for a long time. I love the pc version of Onenote, but needed something more suited to a mobile device. Unfortunately, I haven't been won back from Evernote. I haven't had the problems everyone is talking about, but sadly, some needed features are missing. While I really like being able to make check and bullet lists, not to mention putting in pictures, it's too little too late. If not being able to search within your notes (including text in images like you can on the pc version) is disappointing, than the complete lack of any search feature is a disaster. I'll keep the app for now and hope for updates, but hey, I'm writing this review in Evernote because I know I'll be able to find it later that way. I'll give three stars for rich text editing, but you have to do better than that. Now if due dates could be attached to check boxes, that would be awesome...",1
"Worth the price! I like the simplicity of the integration and the push mode features, status in push mode for days.   Only 4 stars because there are few issues to be ironed out.",1
Same glitches over iPhone and Android One thing that I hate are apps that aim to be professional but miss some important issues big time. This app has a constant problem connecting to my skype account. IM+ keeps trying and trying without any luck. Annoying and frustrating. Same thing I experienced with my former iPhone 3GS and now it's happening again on my Galaxy Nexus running ICS 4.0.2. I reverted to using the free imo.im without any issues.,1
Love it.,0
"I run GTD on my iPhone using the one note app, and it is essential to the way I run my business.  In my opinion, there is absolutely no replacement. It seamlessly links to all of the notes I have on my laptop, it smoothly represents any handwritten notes I have, and it allows me to update or add any additional information to any notes I already have on my phone. This allows me to input current to-do'sthat come to mind in the field, it also allows me to reference any to-do's I have already included in my Onenote set up at home. It is basically the Holy Grail of seamlessly using GTD in a mobile setting.   The app is quick, easy to use, and I have never had a problem with it backing up or losing any information over the last year and a half that I've been using it. A clear and easy five star rating.",1
"to make international calls, or text, nothing beats this app from what I have seen!  I even like it for calls within the U.S. because the voice quality is so good.  Sometimes, the connection is poor, and occasionally calls are dropped, however, when weighed against the big phone providers, it is no different then those services.  a real money saver ...for sure",1
Easy to use. Effective. I would recommend it.,0
Very nice,0
"I can finally zoom into my notes with the new major update today. Microsoft, Kudos, for once you have not charged for the next version.",1
5 estrellas o can talk we my love one and send text,0
Love this app and it's gotten even better without stickers and I get to talk to my friends overseas I think it's a wonderful app,1
