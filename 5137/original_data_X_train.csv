This app crashes frequently. I love it but I may switch over to basic twitter for iPad.,1
"I have an iPhone 5. The scans here are the clearest I've gotten. Tried a few and no luck. I got amazing results with this app!! Easy to use, no watermark, emails fast. Love it!!!!!!!!",1
C- crashes a lot. R- reloads and crash again. A- after reinstalling crash. S- Super CrashH- halfway there. Then crash.,1
L. Try this app.,0
great apps..thanks a lot more power,0
Love It!! High 5!!,0
It used to have many colors. Words overlap on my phone. It says I have tweets but when I click to see them it says its empty.,1
"Not as good as Twitter app, unfortunately.",0
Good game,0
Thanks lot,0
Best thing ever! Thank you now I can talk to my family overseas!,1
Easy to use... I've seen the light 😃 and it's coming from Tiny Scan!!,0
Its fine,0
"PAC-MAN's power. Amazing!!!!,i shot the ghost with laser,BOOM!!!!.Deathly shooter,watch out the glicth you can die,i can die if the Gray Ghost   woke up from sleep.....!!!!,get the Energy Ball for kill the Gray  Ghost or use a power from PAC-MAN,dont use cheat ,if you use a cheat you SUCK.😈",1
i have a lot of fun but I'm stuck because on one of the house of the dead tracks in some areas all I see is my cart and everything is so dark it's pitch black and i end up crashing and falling and i can not progress further because of it.,1
The best app Guys the best app ever. I recommend it :-).,0
Great Works very well,0
So handy Great when you need an electronic version of a document. Extremely useful when so much is done via email and cloud. Image quality is okay and of course dependent on the original.,0
Notification problem I am back to loving this app fully :),1
recent issues all resolved,0
I like it. And it's Free,0
Accelerometer use is WAY too sensitive.,1
"Keeps getting better, new list update works very well. In over 30 years of using and writing software I have never seen as well thought out design and implementation. Like all products there are small bugs and limitations, especially on small screens, but the amazing technology far outweighs the inconveniences. Not many realize the hidden gems in the OneNote ecosystem - smartphone photos with text have OCR applied, sync across platforms is almost instantaneous due to not using platform OS to store data (custom database .one files are outstanding), collaboration allows simultaneous editing with Google Wave like ease, hyperlinks and embedding allow any type info to be stored and accessed, excellent organization strategy of notebooks, pages, and subpages is fully indexed and searchable, etc., etc., etc. MS is ahead of the competition with this product.",1
Still the best I've tried lots of Twitter clients but this one combines tons of powerful tools with an uncluttered design and support for phones and tablets. Not as pretty as newer competitors like Carbon or falcon pro but way more usable.,1
"Better on a computer I loved the flexibility and ability to share and sync across platforms,  but the limited capabilities of the mobile app make me question if it's worth it.  S Note or Evernote  are much more flexible and user friendly.",1
The Best,0
Just downloaded this app & its saying Ive exceeded the twitter limit.,1
I especially like it is truly cross platform. I prefer it to Evernote.,0
"""This app is using a lot of battery."" Google gives me this update shortly after I open the app, without fail, since the latest update. Is this a known issue?",1
Please update so when I send a tweet it doesn't crash.,1
One note Can't even tell you how much this app makes my life so much easier! I'm always on the go and to be able to work on the go is a necessity. Microsoft has all the tools I need. :),1
Very very very very very beautiful,0
Very nice connection including FaceTime. Tried for the first time between USA and Dubai. Recommend for others to try out Viber.,1
Works just fine for me!!!!!!,0
Constantly crashing. There has never been a time I tried to tweet or update my timeline without a crash. It also  needs push notifications. Definitely switching back to the regular twitter app.,1
I can't believe how clear the reception is !!!! No more calling cards!!!,1
Please update it soon. It crashes too often.,1
Loved the new interface and improvements,1
Good app,0
Great,0
Like this app but wish it had push notifications. Will rate higher when updated.,1
Updated rating: (4 star) it finally worked. It initially kept giving me error message while trying to sign in. I just kept trying repeatedly; until finally it went through.. And now it works perfectly. Keep trying folks..However I would like to know-how to add notes on main screen. It just shows Personal(web) on the main screen and I don't see an option to add lists. I do see a screenshot in the app store showing several notes on main page. Previous rating: (1 star)Gives an Error message everytime I try to log in. Someone please tell me how to fix this??,1
"Good, Useful app, well done !",0
"Sonic and sega racing is great on a console, not here. They managed to take all of the fun out of it and instead put in TERRIBLE controls, bland tracks, and decided to not add music during the racing. Not to mention the brutal missions thanks to overwhelming glitches. If you've played the real game, don't bother with this.",1
;),0
If you need to scan stuff this is the app for it.  Have used it for several years and makes my workflow so quickly.  Especially useful for scanning items bound in folders.,1
"This app was great for the first month or two. Now whenever I try to open one of my notes, it says, Syncing Error. Edits saved to SkyDrive. I've been trying to access this note for FOUR DAYS now. I have tried deleting theapp, signing out, refreshing, going to Skydrive, and doing every thing I can to have my note show up! Every time I click on it, like a few lines will show up and the rest is just blanks and the note is all messed up. I am literally in TEARS because that was an IMPORTANT note and it isn't syncing. It's so ridiculous. I can't even copy the text on the note to place it somewhere else. I am so sick of this. I have THREE BARS and full Wi-Fi yet it still won't sync. This app has me in tears because I may never get my important note back.",1
"Since I got the upgrade, the app closes unexpectedly, the bottom bar doesn't work, and it's overall sucky. Please do something to fix this, because I'm ready to find a new twitter app.",1
The best app in the world,0
Having this as an iOS app I can now access ally notes on all my devices.,1
Good,0
"Works well. Good UI. There are undoubtedly ways to improve this app, but I haven't thought of any yet. Been using it for about 3 months..",0

"I make a lot of calls from Germany to USA. If you're on wifi and the other person is on at least 3G, call quality is clear. Still have to try 3G to 3G. Over LTE calls sound so much better than normal phone calls.",1
Very good quality! This application like dream!,0
Love love love it,0
"Thanks Bandai for teaming up with Hipster Whale and putting their spin on this classic. I understand people's want for more content, but I realize this is licensed and any changes to the original are at the discretion of Bandai. That aside, I've always loved Pac-Man, and having it be endless is fantastic! Sure, running out of tokens or lives can be frustrating, but you can play for free without power ups, so win-win because Pac-Man. It'd be nice to have music throughout instead of just before you start. I found out about this game through the 8-4 Play podcast, and during their breaks, they play music. While I was playing, their break came up and they started playing Pac-Man Fever... It was a brief moment ecstasy before I realized it wasn't coming from the game. TL;DR, this is endless Pac-Man, and it scratches that inflamed itch just like Crossy Road (endless frogger) does.",0
I am able to complete my expense statements easily without the worry of finding a scanner on the road!,0
This game is a very good game to play it's fun and endless!!!!,0
Very good,0
I love this app. Have not had any problems so far. Unlike other twitter apps you for not have to pay for the mute feature. Features in this app are so much better than the Twitter app. The only difference in this and the full version is the full has no ads. That is the Only difference.,1
"WOW, real cool.  Can talk international at no cost...",0
"Stops working Disconnection issue, although internet is working fine, worst issue ever from any app ive gone through...",1
Wonderful reception . It's fantastic way of communicating worldwide. Imagine FREE OF CHARGE.,1
It's a great app but still room for improvement.,0
Very versatile!,0
"I'm worried they'll change it like they did on their app Planner Plus. They took my money, and never respond to emails.",1
"Best twitter app so far , but after the last update the ""hide retweet"" option is not working, and the gif still can't be viewed .",1
Love love love this app. Calls are clear and don't drop anymore. Thanks for fixing.,1
Sucks with adds :( The official Twitter App is Better,0
Ads?! What's with the 'Top Apps' ads? I thought thus version was ad-free. :-(,1
"5/3/13 - STILL not getting notifications I'm not getting notifications, and don't notice any new messages until i open the chat (it doesn't even show as new). notification settings are turned on for both active and inactive chats. only when I'm actually on the app does it show i have a message. please fix! ----- months later and still no fix! I check for updates everyday, come on Shape, get it together please!",1

Perfect,0
"Good so far... Fun, have to watch some commercials, but u get stuff for them. Don't know what happens when u run out of credits to play with powerups, also it looks like c-coins aren't credits, could be more clear about that",1
"I had many other apps for the chat, they were all troubling me with ads and were not working well. They were mostly slow. This app works very well most of them time but freezes once in a while. I still don't get easy to use feeling with this app..",1
It's like getting a second brain...,0
Very good App!!!,0
"I was excited for this app but have noticed several shortcomings that will prevent me from using it:1. You have to have a windows live acct to use the app2. You can only create new notebooks online in windows live, not from within the app3. You can not file notes from within the app, you have to do it from windows live4. From windows live, you can not transfer a note from one notebook to a different notebookIn my opinion, skip the windows live and let all the functions be available from within the app... Then it will be a worthwile app, until then, its pretty useless",1
Only improvement would be to get more of my friends on it. I send invites but they are not joining. Can you make the invites somehow more personal.,1
crashes aloott barely can get past the first screen without it crashing,1
"I have been visiting a community where my cell coverage is terrible, and have been having to use land lines to call.  I have just had an hour call with Australia and another one to Seattle.   Crystal clear. Amazing.",1

Single player is cool but every time my friend and I try to play online it goes to the start of the race but never starts. Can any help me with this,1
Love it!!!!,0
The syncing is superb.  I can type on my iPhone or laptop & within seconds it's synced.  No more copy & pasting.,0
Very good quality and features,0
I love it I haven't had no problems so I'm 100 percent happy about thatc,0
Better than regular Twitter.,0
Horrible UI Latest update is just like putting lipstick on an ugly pig. Just holofy the whole thing like you did for Friendcaster already!,1
Pretty amazing,0
It's simple and efficient. I only wish there were options for font and background themesand such.,1
I've had IM+ pro for years. Very happy with it. A week or so ago it wouldn't load. Crashed before it would even open. I reset the app. Nothing. So I deleted it from my phone and re downloaded. I was sent IM + pro 7 and charged yet another 4.99. I was going to avoid making a fuss but sometimes it won't open at all. I have iPhone 4.,1
I really like this game BTW its pretty much the best game I EVER TRIED IT IS AWESOME!!!!! I really like this game is made by a BUNCH OF COMPANY'S I mean people only 3 company's maybe more but I really don't know,0
I didnt hate it ... But..i cant put and receive any code ...!! Bother,1

"Great game, way better than Crossy road",0
AAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!period,0
"What I like about the app is the ability to use some of the old functions of Twitter that are no longer available (e.g., the RT feature). Overall I think the app is a great replacement or alternative to the official Twitter app. I use this one more.",1
"I use this app seriously all the time. I have several tabs to keep everything organized and I could not live without it. We are on the go so much and everything is on our phones, organization is essential. Love it.",0
"Fantastic Too young to have played the original, but this is awesome.",0

Awesome,0
Needs push notifications and see who favorites your tweets.,1
Errors I keep getting a 501 or 504 error.  This is new,1
This game is the coolest thing ever and very addicting,0
This app crashes a lot. Please fix,1
The game is very cool and like the concept of it but only thing is just a few bad ghost glitches like there is the app that shuts down randomly after about 30 mins into it and it shuts down when you don't die for a long time. If the app shutdowns gets fixed it would be a great game.,1
Sometime good and some not,0
Best of them all Best notepad ever,0
This used to be the best app for Twitter. The last couple of upgrades have made usage difficult. Please fix!,1
Best twitter software,0
This twitter app is the best one out there for the iPad. It is easy to use and has a use UI.,1
I really enjoy the organization of this app. And the fact that it backs up online is even better. Unlike the Apple app and they don't charge me for extra storage so far. Haven't had any problems hasn't slowed down. Only thing I would improve is that when you type in the phone number or an email address you can click on it and it would automatically operate with your phone. Pretty cool app overall,1
very good,0
Good game It's kinda like crossy road but it gets boring eslty,0
Very good,0
Makes it all a bit more convenient!,0
"Hi guys. The app is awesome. But the more popular it gets, the more spam i receive. When would you implement report spam button together with blocking the contact? And also when will you allow me to let only existing contacts chat/call me and prevent unknown contacs from sending messages to me? This is getting more and more important each day. Thank you.",1
Best App No better Twitter app around.,0
"Well my twitter app doesn't really work when I press it , won't load , but this app is way smoother and better than the accual twitter app :) 5 $+@r$",1
My viber no longer rings. Is there a way to fix this I keep missing my calls :(,1
do u guys get calls back,0
"Great overall, some niggles In terms of features, this is one of the best Twitter apps I have used. It handles multimedia better than most apps. Only downsides in my experience are the slightly clunky interface and the inability of it to read the EXIF data to orient images the right way.",1
My daughter is vacationing in Denmark and Viber has worked great for communicating with her. The voice quality really is better than a regular phone call and there is no lag. Awesome app. I bought some ViberOut credits just to help support the company.,1
Love this game MUST DOWNLOAD! But needs more characters but it's still great,1
"What I do like: has more features than any other Twitter app I've found. Easy to use. What I don't like: Crashes constantly! Sometimes the navigation bar at the top disappears and I'm stranded, having to restart my phone to reboot the app. The view conversation needs to be simplified. I don't get why it repeats... ???",1
I can't live without!!! I can talk to family members all over the world for free! What can be better?!!!,0
"I love having access to my notes from all my devices!  Everything in one place, I am obsessed!!",0

Slow on old phone The app is great but its very slow. I'm on an HTC EVO 4G and it takes forever to load.,1
"I love onenote - stable, high quality, fantastic UI, just works terrifically well.",1

The application is used almost every day and I am really pleased with it. Great app!!!,0
"I recently purchased shadow with my 750,000 miles however, now he is not available after a crash. And my miles aren't there either. But when I go to my license it shows that I've accumulated 850,000 miles. I saved up for shadow and used him to get that 100,000 extra before the crash. I'm confused why I don't have him any more. Fix",1
Good app I'm unable to connect to my skype account after updating from my previous version. Can you help me to fix it.,1
Bugs in new version,1
Lack of Persian (Arabic) language support I use this app on windows and its support's Persian but when I install this app on my Android phone my notes in Persian language isn't show correctly and characters are desperate from each other,1
Perfection This bring back some good old memories,0
I love it because it's good to talk to other friends I appreciate for that thank you,0
I used the free version once and instantly decided to pay for the full version. Money well spent!,0
Better just to take a picture.10 times better,1
Keep it coming. I would like the feature of creating sub tab categories within the tabs on the iPhone.,1
This would be a great Wii game and the into is great. Maybe some more characters like sonic heroes  for ps2(any one remember?on the Dreamcast? Game cube? so ya maybe character groups and race like that.,1
The best Fast and smooth,0
Great application! I use it all the time!,0
I downloaded because I have the PC version. I don't care for the fact that you have a Windows Live ID. I went to the trouble of creating one only to find there's not much you can do with the app. In my opinion the native app is better as you have some font choices and I can delete a note. I haven't figured out how to do so. I have another note application & it's much better. It was free so at least I didn't waste any money.,1
This game is so hard to play!!! Every time I turn it on everything goes fine 😃😃 until the race is loading😢. The game closes and I end up at my home screen.  😡😡 Please fix this!! 😡,1
I'm a teacher & I find myself frequently having to scan documents. This app has been so productive & handy for my usage. I've scanned my own made study guides & posted them to my student web page virtually working toward a paperless environment. This app is the best & the option to save the document to Dropbox is ideal! Love it!!!,1

I like this game The game was amazing like,0
"after I input my name and choose the nationality, the game crash on my devices all the time, hope you can fix it asap.",1
"Initially playing this game, I was skeptical, as many game reboots fail to deliver a quality that represents the original game.  This game is an exception.  Not only do the clean graphics and fun gameplay represent Pac Man well, but this game is quite possibly more fun than the original.  A big thumbs up to Namco and Hipster Whale for this amazing game!",1

"This new version needs to be fixed because there are some bogs in there. When i want to see the photos that i sent to my friends, it jumps out of apps. Some times i cannot open the appPlease fix itThanks",1
There is no way I could afford keeping in touch with my loved ones. Viber makes that possible.,1
Easy to use. No more spiral note books for me.,0
I've tried Evernote which is certainly a great product but the features of OneNote are just a bit easier to use. Keep up the great development!!,1
Wish it showed quoted tweets I wish it actually showed quoted tweets instead of just the link.,1

Best thing that ever happened to our family - we can chat and keep up-to-date with all our activities and events!  Thank you! Love ... Love this app!!!!,0
I use this app all the time internationally. It works perfectly! I love it.,0
For $4 I want more It works well for a couple of weeks then I have to uninstall b.c it force closes without opening. Retweets should be displayed in the @ mention column. Color coding the tweets per user would be nice as well. And a real in app browser that shows more than the mobile page:) paid $4 for this app... I deserve it.,1
"It's not a bad app to use if your out of minutes or texts, it's really easy to use and helps you to be connected with your acquaintance and contacts for free!

"Great Client! I've been a user of IM+ since I had a  Treo 650 with PalmOS. I've used it on many platforms and loved it over the years, as both a paid (multiple times) and free user. But lately, it seems like the Android version isn't keeping pace with the iOS version. Skype support works there, but not here. Fix this with an update (even a paid one!), Shape, and I'll gladly up this review to 5 stars.",1
"Have come back Used you, was seduced elsewhere.  And now, sheepishly, am back.  Missed you!",0
Getting worse? I like it when there was Friendcaster to go with it. My current version becoming more unresponsive?,1
I used to be able to play individual maps just not the grand prix but now I can't race at all.,1
Works beyond  belief!! TweetCaster Pro has everything you need most of the other apps  do not have a delete button if you want to delete a tweet  and don't have the proper Rte retweet too...  this is so smooth and you can custom design it... I love it! The only way to use Twitter!!,1
"First time I tried to start onenote, 15 seconds passed, and it still didn't finish loading. At this time I knew this app would only aggravate me every time I used it.  I'll spare myself.",1

I love this game but this keeps crashing my iPod. Please fix this! I have the 4th generation iPod. Thanks!,1
amazing,0
Love this app as you can cast your tweets to both social networks! Only downfall is that you can't add additional FB accounts.,1
"Good game - stupid in-app credit system I like that the ads are optional for rewards rather unavoidable, but they ought to reward you with credits since that's ultimately what you need to enjoy all the features of the game. What are these stupid non-credit 'c's even for?",1
Best Twitter app I've found. Only issue I'm having is that it won't let me connect to FB. Very annoying since I paid for the PRO version.,1
Incredible app,0
"I love this program, but I absolutely hate the fact that I can't delete my unused notebooks very easily. Having to log in to my cloud every time I decide to clean out my notebooks is extremely inconvenient.",1
Disconnects Always Barely works! I always lose my connection. I'm not the only one either if you read reviews.,1
Free calling stopped working. Eating up space with inadequate performance uninstalling it.,1
"I have several friends from outside the USA and now that smart phones are pretty prevalent, it's easy to access this app!  It's so good to actually hear their voices instead of just reading text. The only complaint I would have is that you need to have really good Internet service on both ends when talking on the phone. Otherwise it's an excellent form of texting using just 3G or 4G! If I didn't have this app then texting would be $0.50 PER TEXT!!Five stars. Recommended app!",1
Thank you so much. The sound quality is unbelievable. Plus being free is just icing in the cake.,1

Living on a military deployment and this a great medium to keep in touch back home. More robust text app than Apple's app.  Thank you Viber.,1
I travel for a living and Viber works better than my FaceTime! Even when it says poor quality I still seem to have a great connection.,1
I use this program every day for both business and personal stuff. I love that it automatically syncs to all of my devices.,1
"I can scan, email to gmail and print. Love this app!",1
This app. Is thes way to comunicate!!Wao!! Thank.,0
Viber seems to always end your calls after five or six mins onto your conversation.  It gets so frustrating and irritating when u have to constantly keep calling back to the other party.. Please fix this!! Does anyone have this problem?,1
Good game I guess its a good game and is also VERY addicting i have only had it for 2 days amd have been on it non stop,0
Love this app thanks,0
I love this game to my hearts content ❤️ I live this game everyday I soon figured out its like Crossy Road but much better! And what the concept of the game is and what it means: U r on lvl 256 and the glitch u r running away from is the glitch of lvl 256 in the original Pac-Man! Cool huh?! Well I love this game so yeah! 5 Stars no doubt,1
Way better than the native iphone app.,0
Great app Worth the purchase,0
Addicting Great time killer,0
Their latest update is dumb as all hell. People don't want the back button to disappear when opening a picture. I'm going to kill myself if they don't change this. Emotionally.,0

Can't access files saved on anything except OneDrive I can't access my files saved on Google docs.  This application only allows me to see files saved to my onedrive.  Well...Onedrive doesn't like the onenote file extension.  this proprietary stuff is for the birds and Apple products.  Please address this.,1
The gesture to swipe right to view the menu is interfering with the scrolling gesture making navigation a pain. Otherwise great ap.,1
Profile photo problem Can't see profiles properly and I also can't see photos in profiles.. but works pretty well..,1

"Call Quality is above par, very clear.",1

Hi folks just make sure both parties have internet connection either wifi or 3G. Works flawlessly. Super duper fast and very awesome to use. Only thing I would want more from this app is the ability to set custom text tones. Right now nothing in the settings that you can use to assign different/custom text tones.,1

"Well done Microsoft!! OneNote is a fantastic program, perfect for day to day stuff and college notes. In fact, everything where a word processor isn't quite the write [sic] tool. I've been waiting for an iPhone app to use OneNote remotely, and this exceeds my expectations!!If you are a OneNote user, I really can't see how you could be disappointed with this perfect companion. Great looking and does the job perfectly!(I had a problem signing in at first, but resubmitted a few times and it worked - now I have no trouble logging in)",1

"Newest release much better Now that the ability to add sections has been added, the app is much better and mimics the desktop platform. Well done.  --previous review-- The best note taking app I have come across. Great app and syncs all notes well with the desktop app on my PC. It is still a bit limited in that new notebooks nor sections can be added within the app (hence only 3 of 5 stars), you need to create these on the PC. On e they are created the ability to access and edit them in the app is simple and efficient.",1
Great app,0
So far impressed. Talking to our son in Japan as he travels.,0
"Since upgrading to an iPhone tweeting with Tweetcaster is great! I can do so much more, xoxo.",1
"Great app if you use MS office, it syncs well with their one note utility. Only wish  you could specify which folder a new note goes into.",1
The latest update has its good and bad but mostly bad. I can't scroll when texting so I can't return to the beginning of my message before I send. I've noticed that the message doesn't send when you swipe upwards now which is a plus. The main issue is the notifications. There's no sound when someone calls you. This causes many missed calls.,1

The game doesn't allow you to make the moves in the direction you intend.,1
This is a very fun and addicting game almost as good as the original but who wants an exact copy? We already have a version of the near original pac man to download and they have some at arcades still so it's good to find an addicting different version that almost as good as the most original and it seems like it's based a bit on pixels.,1
I can't update it in my phone it takes way too much memory.,1

"This is a very easy to use app as it gives you the option to post not only to Twitter but to Facebook as well. Very customizable and clean lay out. However, as with all Twitter apps it lacks the ability to accept follow requests. I think it should be free but not bad. Also, I HATE the lack of push notifications, if I'm not on my app I don't realize I've been mentioned or have been sent a private message. Otherwise, by far my favorite twitter app.",1
Very good solution for long-distance relationship mobile bills 😃,0

"I've tried almost every note-taking app there is available on the market, and this is the only one that I'll use; however, with that being said, I would like to have more options available to allow for more organization. First and foremost, I would really appreciate the ability to rearrange/delete/etc. notebooks directly from the app instead of OneDrive (I prefer that my notebooks be in alphabetically order.) Also, I heavily rely on colors for organization, so if there were I way that I could manage those as well that would be absolutely perfect.",1
I was told about other applications that didn't work overseas.  This app does exactly what it says and the cut offs are minimum depending on your wifi service.  It has been awesome in keep me connected to my family. Absolutely must download.,1

Not only hand writing.  Id be very happy for this. Thanks in advance",1
I'd give it a minus star! It's constantly telling me I'm not authorized! tells me I've reached my 350 max tweets per minute after my FIRST tweet of the day! CONSTANTLY CRASHING.

"3 months later, still no iPhone 5 support.  Clearly a crippled version of OneNote.  Want to indent, create numbered lists, or format text?  Sorry, you need to buy a Windows Phone for that.  The message is clear:  iPhone users, you're second-class citizens with OneNote.  Stick to Evernote or any other note-taking app that doesn't suffer from conflicts of interest.",1

"Love this app as my boyfriend is in Hong Kong. Saving us a lot of money! I would love if this app would allow for me to change ringtones. You also can't share a file and message in the same text. Copy and paste features aren't available, etc. can't wait for future iterations.",1
OK. Needs to be faster to play,1
"This is a ghost app! Doesn't really work! No support for a stylus, can't even enter details on a ask the community support page. It think its just a super sized iPhone app for reading onenote files created elsewhere.",1

"I have been a daily Skype user for years. Could not live without it either at home or at work. Just discovered Viber and found that a lot of my friends found it ahead of me! I was astonished at how easy the set up was, and the call quality is great. Skype still has many more features, more ability to customize, etc. but I'm sure this is all coming with Viber. I am not giving up on Skype, especially since I use it from my computer at work most of the time, but Viber is a great new addition to the communications suite.",0
"It's saves you money and helps to be close to your loved one when you are away. I use DID Groundwire app, Skype, Google Voice and few other apps and services when travel in Europe or Asia. Viber works better then all of them. EZ to call and text. Only minus- no video calls...",1

"I've been using this onenote for 5 years in my desktop. When the app came out for Ipad, i wasn't impressed so i tried other apps. But when i tried this updated onenote, i was totally hooked again and i think i'll be sticking with this one. Good job guys!",0
Dope shizz my nizz Use it on all devices.,0
Nice Every day must have app,0
The mobile version got me to finally begin using onenote! Excellent all storage facility,1
Performs as expected. The layout works well on a mobile device. Syncs well with all other versions on desktop and mobile devices. I recommend OneNote without any reservations.,1
Cant post to my facebook Can connect to my facebook updates! Fix,1
Only app getting worse. Now has popups for a candy game that takes you from a tweet to the app store. Stalls every time  you write a tweet. Trying to keep it for the zip feature but its getting ridiculous.,1
Almost perfect,0
Excellent quality on wifi as well as cellular data. Must have app for smartphones.,1

Add push notification!,1
"Great App but need save to sd ability The ability to create a searchable notebook that I could add photos and drawing to was perfect. However. As you can't transfer information without using onedrive has rendered this app useless. My workplace deals with sensitive information and prohibits use of external servers such as onedrive etc. If the app was able to save to my phones sd, I could manually transfer the file across to my work pc. It truely is the best notebook app that I am unable to used.",1
Viber was the one the best social app ever but there is problem for iPhone 6 plus...Please optimize this app for iPhone 6 plus.,1

"Can't sync more than one notebook I didn't expect to take note with it, only to read my notes taken with my computer. But it can only sync one notebook, and that still took forever. And you can't easily export the content of your note either. Very disappointed.",1
Is it similiar The game is really fun to play but is it similiar to cross road cause that's what I think?,0
"Truly yes When I enter the apps,missing the tweet",1
"I never use a twitter app better that this one! Is awesome, high recommended",1
"When you Follow several prolific Twitter accounts, and don't get any updates for days, y'know it's not just you. It's the app. I deleted it and reinstalled and updated once, and stopped soon after. Too bad, this was a great Twitter feed app.",1
Thank you Finally fixed the Facebook issue. Five stars after a week.,1
"I was very excited when I saw this app pop up.  It was the one thing that was keeping me from buying an ipad.  But when I finally got logged in, I couldn't see any of my ink, much less anter any free hand content.  This is the power of onenote, and it's completely impotent.",1
"For the most part, slow sometime though",1
Used to be good until the last update. Tried contacting the company for advice and they never responded. Don't use this app and certainly don't spend money on it.,1
"Amazing app, works perfect with my family and clients around the world!",0
Love it Love it! Wish we could view recent pics on twitter profiles though!,1
"It keeps crashing on me. I'm sure its a great game, but for some reason it wont let me play",1
Viber is my life Can make free calls free video messages omg wat will they create again,1
"Hours of time wasted I spent weeks taking notes on both my laptop and inking on my Note 10.1. In several of my pages, I went back to find that large segments of inked text somehow migrated onto other segments above and below. Unbelievably disappointed. Devistatingly  unreliable.",1
My girlfriend got this app so we can talk while she was in England. And since I was new to the iPhone it was easy to learn and use. The texting is awesome and fast and the calls work like a charm.,1
The most recent update improved the speed. Thanks.,1
This program is more than a refresher,0

Was working fine but new version occasionally drops added notes,1
"I've been looking forward to seeing any MS Office mobile apps for iOS, and onenote is pretty good for the first MS Office app. I really like how it links with office live web apps which can be synced with the onenote desktop app. I can't wait until MS makes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.",1
"Overheating too much yes, this is the best twitter client so far but new features of 'Who retweeted this' should not be changed, beforehand we don't have to go to the link for that features  one more thing profile viewer features of more than one profile please make updated version just like usual. Other else, it overheated too much and many advertisements please look into this. Anything else is perfect make it more smooth u r the best among all",1
"There's times it has good quality but theres also poor quality and the echo is really bad, you can only hear yourself talking but it fixes the problem when you disconnect/end call and reconnect again/call.",1
"Pretty good Has trouble with Vines and doesn't display quoted tweets in line (normally), but I still prefer it over the twitter app",1
very useful and cost effective especially if u have to make international calls,1
what's happening not conmecting to twitter server for few days now,1
Best game ever,0
Excellent tool for tweeting Organizes my thoughts and allows me to quickly share them with others.  I use this the majority of the time vs. my pc.,0
"After using Tweetcaster for a couple years I had an issue for several months where it adamantly refused to let me even log in to my Facebook, nevermind trying to post to it. I switched to Hootsuite and lost a couple features for stability. Elected to try this one again and all was mostly well, but now I can't view pictures in the timeline anymore. If I click on them it opens Safari, and unless I log in there I can't view my friends' pics if their account is private (which most are). Very irritating. Looks like I'm going back to Hootsuite, at least for now.",1
Couldn't ask for a better twitter app!,0
Wonderful 😊,0
Awesome and very much helpful,0
Good Great game,0
etails It does not allow to use the keyboard when the PEN is extracted from a Samsung Note tablet. I do not understand why they do not implement simple and functional details like the ability to share a note or select the entire note to copy it to the clipboard? It is a very good tool but there are some simple things that would make it match the competition ... another is the creation of the sections from the Android client ...,1
"Easy to use, highly recommend",0
"Great Very useful for keeping track of all sorts and in one document and, available on all devices",0
I love OneNote and use it across my devices.  The user experience on my phone is almost as fast as a native app and feels great to use.,1

I LOVE IT! Good memories of this old game and love the new angle and some new characters like Glitchy.,1
"Won't let me retweet a person with a private account. Besides that, everything is good",1
This would be the beat twitter app o it didn't crash so often and if you could get it to post to Facebook but most o the time there is trouble. I love it when it works and cuss it most of the time because it doesn't. Also the support from onelouder is terrible. They always say to uninstall & reinstall. Done that 3 times!!!,1
Worked from Africa!,0
"Downhill Brilliant client, great support",0
Easy to use. Quality scans and provides almost all the controls you could want. My only suggestion is to offer an option of exporting as different format such as jpg,1
"I would give the original 5 stars! I relied on this app to sync ALL MY COLLEGE NOTES from office 365 and it fails to load any of them now, the original ios onenote worked flawlesdly for je. Microsoft please release an update to allow us to revert back to the original or fix this broken app. Absolutely unacceptable.",1
Love the call quality of this app......works really great...,0
"I would love this if it gave me notifications like echofon did. Like when somebody faved my tweet, etc.",1
"It's gotten worse As other reviewers have said recent updates have turned this formerly outstanding app into a crash mobile.  I'm using another app until it's fixed.  HootSuite is ok, but Tweetcaster should be better.   Right now, it's not.",1
Whatever PAC man,0

"I actually love this app but it crashes and kicks you off at times. I use TweetCaster for iPad so maybe that's why because they recently put the iPad version out. Anyhow they ate working on it and tech reps do send me updates all the time. Other then that, this app is fantastic.. I would have given 5stars if it was not kicking me off but 4 stars are good enough for right now. Hopefully you guys fix these minor issues. Thanx",1
